            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Special Verdict Againſt the PROTESTANT RECONCILER.</head>
            <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> foretold that after his departure <hi>grievous Wolves ſhould enter in</hi> (with a deſign and malice) not to ſpare but <hi>to devour the Flock:</hi> theſe were Wolves in Sheeps cloathing, whoſe buſineſs was to ſteal, to kill and to deſtroy; but theſe were not all, and perhaps not the moſt pernicious of the Churches Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: He foretells further, that <hi>alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things to draw Diſciples after them.</hi> And this Prophecy is fulfilled in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66530:3"/> our <hi>Reconciler.</hi> For among others he is riſen up, with his perverſe Principles, to make and engage a Party.</p>
            <p>Had he intended the ſatisfaction or information of his <hi>Superiors,</hi> his Duty would have prompted him to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his Papers humbly into their hands and with a modeſt ſubmiſſion to have expected the reſult of their wiſe Councils. But a <hi>Noverint <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſi</hi> was fitter to carry on his popular Deſign, and to <hi>careſs</hi> his dear Vain-glory.</p>
            <p>He ſhould have come in the Spirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> to turn the hearts of the Fathers unto the Children, the Holy Fathers Mind and Principles, their Faith and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections into the Children: and <hi>the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to the Wiſdom of the Juſt:</hi> That what the Fathers have believed and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed,<note place="margin">

            <p>He could have told them, that Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aſſured his Diſciples that God, who hears the Addreſſes of His Church, he ſtreightly commands them alſo to hear Her, upon pain of forfeiting Her (which is the ſame with His) Bleſſing; being deſervedly (for their contumacy in their Diſobedience) turned out of Her Communion as Publicans and Heathens.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66530:3"/>
            <p>He might have been pleaſed to take notice, how Chriſt reſolves the caſe of Conſcience about the <hi>Tythe</hi> of <hi>Mint</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> and the weightier matters of the Law, ſaying unto ſuch as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to be well informed, <hi>Theſe things</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 23. 23.</note> 
               <hi>ought ye to have done and not to have left the other undone.</hi> How Chriſt obſerved not only the ſervice ſolemnly eſtabliſhed, but ſuch Cuſtoms and Feſtivals as had no divine Inſtitution, laying down this for a Rule of Conſcience; <hi>Thus it behoves us to fulfill all Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He might have put them in mind (as<note place="margin">Matth. 3. 15. Tit. 3. 1.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts) to be ſubject to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Powers, and to obey their Spiritual Guides in their Conduct and to ſubmit to their Orders; in regard that<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 7. 17. 1 Cor. 14.</note> the ſpirit of the very Prophets ought to be ſubject to the greater authority of the Prophets.</p>
            <p>He knows very well, that we ought not to be contentious about the Cuſtoms and Practices of the Church, when they do not ſuperſede the Commands of God, nor interfere with them. That the Governors of the Church have a great Authority from our Lord, and are intruſted in his ſtead to ſet things in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for Edification and Decency in Gods
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66530:4"/> public Worſhip and Service. And when they have done this with great prudence and deliberation, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are to do their duty without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring or diſputing, and to honour ſuch their Governors very highly for their work-ſake.</p>
            <p>If not, he could have informed his Readers, That Chriſt hath furniſht thoſe Governors with the power of the <hi>Keys</hi> to ſhut the door as well as to open it, with a <hi>Rod</hi> for Diſcipline, Authority to <hi>mark</hi> and <hi>cenſure,</hi> to <hi>admoniſh</hi> and <hi>rebuke ſharply,</hi> to ſtop their mouths who ſpeak preverſe things, and to reject them from the Communion of Chriſt's Church, if they will neither obey her commands, nor regard her admonitions.</p>
            <p>Are they not entruſted by our Lord to make Orders for Diſcipline, and to take the meaſures of Decency by their own Judgment and Prudence? and when they have eſtabiſhed all things to God's Glory, the Peace and Edification of the Church, is it our Duty to follow our Guides or to controul them? to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front our Governors or to obey them?</p>
            <p>When a difference aroſe betwixt the Jews and Gentile Converts, 'twas thought the moſt prudent and likely
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66530:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> Way to compoſe it, to have recourſe to<note place="margin">Acts 15.

But our <hi>Reconciler</hi> takes another courſe to <hi>buoy</hi> up a ſinking Cauſe and Faction; He Cenſures all the Governors of Church and State; decrys their Impoſitions and directly quarrels their Authority.</p>

            <p>For this reaſon the Apoſtle does ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently extol Authority, and ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inculcate and preſs that Subjection and Obedience, which is juſtly due to it:</p>
            <p>Thus St. <hi>Peter</hi> commands the <hi>Jews</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13. to 17. Tit. 3. 1. 1 Tim. 2. 1.</note> to obey <hi>Kings</hi> and ſuch as Governed by their Commiſſion. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyns <hi>Titus</hi> to admoniſh thoſe under his charge to obey <hi>the higher Powers;</hi> And <hi>Timothy</hi> to make <hi>publick Prayers</hi> for them. And this he does with the greateſt care and concern, when he writes to the Chriſtians at <hi>Rome;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Animoſities and Diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> were high, and nothing could be acted by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi> of the Goſpel there that looked ſo like Sedition, without the apparent hazard of the whole Church.</p>
            <p>And this Doctrine, ſaith he, is no leſs needful <hi>now</hi> than <hi>heretofore,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the rage and madneſs of thoſe <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent</hi> Spirits, the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> who abuſe their <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> to overthrow the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate.</hi>

            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:66530:6"/>
            <p>For <hi>they</hi> preſume, They are <hi>Abraham's Seed</hi> too, not <hi>Semen Carnis,</hi> but <hi>Semen Foederis,</hi> The <hi>Spiritual Iſrael</hi> of God, and his <hi>peculiar People;</hi> and conſequently intituled to all the <hi>Prerogatives,</hi> which the Scripture attributes to thoſe under that <hi>Character.</hi> And being puft up with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their <hi>Spiritual Dignity,</hi> they look upon all Princes as Gods Enemies, and Uſurpers of a <hi>Spiritual Juriſdiction,</hi> which they think does not belong unto them. Hereupon they are ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to mutiny, and raiſe Sedition to ſhake off that Yoak, which they falſly conceive to be <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical,</hi> and to aſſert that <hi>Lawleſs Liberty,</hi> which they miſtake for their <hi>Chriſtian Priviledg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Does not the <hi>Reconciler</hi> too much favour ſuch <hi>Factions,</hi> and encourage the like <hi>Anabaptiſtical Outrages</hi> and run into the ſame <hi>exceſs of Riot,</hi> upon the like <hi>unjuſt</hi> account of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty?</hi> I am ſure he has given the <hi>Alarm</hi> to awaken the <hi>Jealouſie</hi> of Princes, by abetting ſuch peeviſh quarrels at their commendable Impoſitions.</p>
            <p>For what is his Practice and the buſineſs of this Book? He ſpeaks faintly of the Subjects Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but falls foul upon his Superiors; whom he condemns for their care to keep out the <hi>Wolf</hi> and the <hi>little Foxes;</hi> and attempts to overthrow their Authority by ſuch weak and <hi>fallacious</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments as have been baffled twenty times over; or elſe they are nothing to the purpoſe; or may be retorted with greater force upon the Party he takes upon him to plead for.</p>
            <p>For (1.) He ſuppoſes men to be <hi>weak,</hi> and then he pleads ſtifly for a <hi>Toleration</hi> for them; yea, he ſuppoſes them to be <hi>ſuch weak ones,</hi> and under <hi>ſuch</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:66530:6"/> circumſtances, as thoſe were in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> time, and then alledges S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on their behalf. Theſe are <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis dicta</hi> and falſe ſuppoſitions, which he can find no ground for among all the Fathers he heaps together to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance his <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> for which of them did ever condemn the Cuſtoms and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Church in their times, upon the account of any thing deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the contrary in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles?</p>
            <p>Yet (2.) He ſuppoſes a <hi>Multitude</hi> of Rites and Ceremonies among us, and ſuch as have nothing in them of real goodneſs, or of poſitive Order, Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Reverence; but ſuch as are burdenſome and ſcandalous, and theſe unjuſtly impoſed, (which would be true enough if he could prove them to be ſuch) and then as ſuch he diſputes againſt them. And indeed his deſign is to deſtroy all Authority in matters of indifferency; and to extend this falſe and Seditious Doctrine to the utmoſt, to blind and harden ſuch as have raſhly (I will not ſay maliciouſly) kickt at their Governors, and taken a vain oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſtumble into Schiſm, He reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not only the ſymbolical proteſtation
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66530:7"/> of Chriſtianity by the ſign of the Croſs, but the external worſhip of God, by bowing and kneeling, amongſt things indifferent. p. 39. 76, iii.</p>
            <p>We are therefore concerned to take into conſideration, (1.) The Perſons ſuppoſed to be weak and (2.) the Things they take occaſion to ſcruple at.</p>
            <p>I. Men may be weak either in their Faith or in their Morals. Theſe laſt come not under our conſideration in this Controverſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Him that is weak in the Faith,</hi> ſaith<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 1.</note> the Apoſtle; Faith is here taken for knowlege of Divine matters, eſpecially<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 3. 6.</note> of our Chriſtian Liberty; that a man underſtands the difference of days and meats eſtabliſh'd by the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be taken away by Chriſt under the diſpenſation of the Goſpel. (<hi>Calixt. ad Rom.</hi> 14. 1.) The Apoſtles obſervation was that all men had not this Knowledge. And theſe were the<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 7.</note> Apoſtles weak ones.</p>
            <p>For (1.) they had been bred under <hi>another diſpenſation,</hi> the Diſcipline of a Ceremonial Law, which ſtood by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, and being of Gods own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, it had the greater force and tye upon the Conſcience, and prevailed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66530:7"/> the more by bearing the Image of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Antiquity, for Cuſtom which had inured them to the practice of it had a Prepoſſeſſion and made it little leſs than Natural.</p>
            <p>(2.) On the other ſide they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off to another Diſpenſation which totally evacuated the force of that Law, and reſcinded all thoſe Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to which they had been ſo long accuſtomed.</p>
            <p>Now, that an Inſtitution eſtabliſhed with ſo much Grandeur, Dread and Majeſty ſhould quite loſe its Authority; and that they ſhould have a power to ſhake off that Yoak which had been put upon the Necks of their Reverend and Holy Fathers by God himſelf; this was the great ſtumbling-block, and the Objection they ſcrupled at.</p>
            <p>They were but Novices in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but newly called to the Profeſſion of the Goſpel; and they did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly underſtand the Nature of the Chriſtian Liberty; this was their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and their perſons are recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us under the title of <hi>little ones,</hi> of <hi>Babes in Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>weak Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such little ones, tho their judgments were weak, if their hearts were ſound
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66530:8"/> and their Faith unfeigned, Chriſt had a great compaſſion for them. <hi>Take heed ye offend not one of theſe little ones that believe in me:</hi> And ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> for his Babes in Chriſt; <hi>Him that is weak</hi>

            <p>But did either St. <hi>Paul</hi> or Chriſt cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er them up in their childiſh weakneſs, and indulge them to continue Babes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways (<hi>as our Reconciler does?</hi>) Did not our Bleſſed Lord chide his Diſciples Duncery in his School? <hi>O ye of little Faith!

            <p>'Tis a very ſevere concluſion of Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> and he takes it from Chriſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in curing the blind man which gave ſo great a ſcandal to the Phariſees. By this example (ſaith he) we are taught<note place="margin">John 9. 14.</note> that ſuch as are enemies to the truth of the Goſpel, may be exaſperated, <hi>ac eos prorſus deſipere,</hi> and thoſe Reconcilers do but play the fool, who do attempt to coaks the World into a fellow-ſhip with Chriſt, as to condemn all emergent Offences; when Chriſt himſelf does ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wittingly and willingly nettle and provoke the wicked. <hi>Tenenda ergo, quam alibi praeſcribit, regula,</hi> we muſt therefore obſerve that Rule which He preſcribes in another place, that the <hi>blind leaders</hi>

               <hi>of the blind</hi> are to be neglected.</p>
            <p>We muſt be very careful therefore to obſerve as <hi>Hemmingius</hi> doth (<hi>ad Rom.</hi> 14. 1.) that in this point of tenderneſs, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch weak ones as had not yet fully learned the nature and uſe of their Chriſtian Liberty, <hi>&amp; non de

               </note> remarkably of regarding the infirmities of the weak, <hi>nam malitiam nemo pius tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerit aut non oderit etiam,</hi> for no good man will endure ſuch a ones malice, but rather hate it.

               <hi>trahunt compendium:</hi> That they who ſtudy to ſerve their own ends, and do nothing but what they can draw to their own advantage, do wonderfully pleaſe themſelves in that piece of Scripture; and ſo doth our Reconciler.</p>
            <p>But (2.) willful and affected Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance does excommune us from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of a weak Brother as well as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and ſtubbornneſs: We muſt not<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. ad Rom. 14. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 26.</note> think (ſaith St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance will be ſufficient for our Defence: for there will come a time when we ſhall be puniſh'd for our ignorance; that is to ſay, when ignorance it ſelf ſhall find no pardon. For the <hi>Jews</hi> were ignorant, but they were ignorant of thoſe things, the ignorance whereof deſerves (or ſhall
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66530:10"/> obtain) no pardon: the <hi>Greeks</hi> alſo were ignorant, but they have no excuſe. For if thou art ignorant of ſuch things as cannot be known, thy ignorance is not culpable: but if thou be'ſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of thoſe things which are both poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and eaſie to be known, thou do'ſt deſervedly ſuffer extreme puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Let us take heed therefore that we be not impoſed upon by the vizor or fraud of pretended little ones. Theſe Diſſenters would (one while) be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed weak Brethren: but upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can we eſteem them ſo? were they bred up (as the <hi>Jews</hi> were under <hi>Moſes</hi>) under another Diſpenſation? Were they taught another Goſpel than what S. <hi>Paul</hi> Preached? If they were; I am ſure they have not ſo learned Chriſt. If they were nurſed up in falſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples from their Childhood, is it not high time for them to put away thoſe childiſh things? have they not had time enough and means enough to be better informed? are they not of age and of capacity to underſtand the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practice of the Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty? what it is in it ſelf, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of its nature, and what it is in its uſe, when it is limited and determined by Authority.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:66530:10"/>
            <p>But they ſtudy to contend, and to build themſelves up in Faction. They give themſelves up to vain jangling and perverſe diſputings, inſtead of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and modeſt addreſs unto their duty,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> which they are obliged to perform <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mumuring and diſputing.</hi> If theſe be S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Babes in Chriſt, I am ſure they are very froward ones. But they aſſume the title of weak Brethren for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends, their weakneſs improves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Faction, and therein they ſtrengthen themſelves, and boaſt of their might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Right and all Authority and Power, nothing will ſerve their turn but Chriſt on his Throne, and that muſt be one of their own make, according to their own imagination; and therefore 'tis no wonder, they think he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aſcend it without the help of their Sedition.</p>
            <p>Juſt ſuch weak ones were thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks which infeſted <hi>Germany</hi> in the infancy of the Reformation, well eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they were at firſt for their preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive well-meaning, pitied for their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and countenanced for their zeal and fair pretenſions unto Godlineſs: but when they began to ſet up themſelves in their taking Arms for Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66530:11"/> and to oppoſe all eſtabliſht Order and Government but their own; the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thought it high time (when they had unmaſq'd their hypocriſie) to lay aſide their own compaſſion and kindneſs and to deal with them according to their deſerts, at the rate of head-ſtrong and ſturdy Rebels.</p>
            <p>But from the Perſons he pleads for, under the feigned notion of weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren (whoſe pulſe and temper we may be called upon to feel and examine a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more preciſely hereafter) let us paſs on to conſider the things he pleads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, as things indifferent, whihc he thinks to be no leſs imprudently than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably impoſed.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt premiſe, that, this <hi>Reconciler,</hi> is as like to be an <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>For has he any order from his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours to undertake the part of a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler? did they furniſh him with inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and give him his Rules and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to guide him in a matter of this importance to Church and State? or has
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66530:11"/> he any Commiſſion from the Diſſenters to act and play the Advocate on their behalf? have they made their laſt Will and Teſtament about things indifferent? Does he know what they are content to bequeath to the Church, or what they are reſolved to take from it? Can he tell what will fully ſatisfie their ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity, and bring them into ſo hearty a compliance with us as may ſettle a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and a ſeaſonable conformity amongſt us? if he can produce no delegation to this effect (the deſign he goes upon run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Counter to the Laws and Cuſtoms eſtabliſht) his attempt will be ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and appear to conſiſt of as many and as impertinent fooleries as thoſe he has ſo civilly charged the Learned <hi>Meiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> with. But let us proceed.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> the great Law-giver was about to make the Tabernacle (a Type of the Church) he was admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed thus of God, <hi>ſee that thou make</hi>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66530:12"/> that pattern. Now parallel to the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern on the Mount, the Apoſtles had the mind of Chriſt after his frequent Sermons and private diſcourſes. And<note place="margin">Acts 1.

And a proſpect of this Pattern, we have in thoſe General Rules of the Apoſtles, <hi>let all things be done decently and in order, to publick edification and the Glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were the Pattern on the Mount under the New Teſtament, the Ritual Law of the Holy Goſpel, by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the Authority of Governors is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and directed.

And if this were well obſerved it would preſently free them from all their doubts and ſcruples as well as from their Schiſm; which can never be excuſed, unleſs they can prove, that their Governors do act contrary to the divine Canon, in which caſe only, they may plead with S. <hi>Peter whether it be right, &amp;c.</hi> But<note place="margin">Acts 4. 19.</note> the <hi>Reconciler</hi> can never make uſe of that Plea againſt our Governors in favour of the Diſſenters (if he reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66530:12"/> them amongſt S. <hi>Pauls</hi> weak ones) becauſe he confeſſes (p. 73.) the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle has made as perfect and full a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination againſt them as words can make.</p>
            <p>And 'tis a little ſtrange to obſerve the want of Ingenuity in this <hi>Reconciler:</hi> (according to the wonted practice of the Party) he repeats their Cavils and Objections, but never takes notice of the Anſwers that have been returned; it ſeems they have been refuted with ſo much ſtrength of reaſon, that he thought himſelf not able enough to grapple with it. But this is not all, he makes a great cry againſt the impoſition of unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ceremonies, as if the Conſtitution of this Church were over-burthened, and the good Seed of the Goſpel choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the multitude of them, when in truth upon a ſtrict examination they will not amount unto a number. For we may obſerve</p>
            <p>That he reckons ſome obſervances among things indifferent, which really are not ſo. He does inſtance in bowing and kneeling, which are parts of Gods external Worſhip, ſuggeſted by the light of nature, and enjoyned by the ſecond precept of the Moral Law; which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66530:13"/> command binds always (<hi>ſemper non ad ſemper</hi>) but becauſe this exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Worſhip may be exhibited in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral geſtures of the Body, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be all performed at once, therefore it is left to the wiſdom of the Church to determine it (<hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi>) for place and ſeaſon; for which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding She wants not Her ſufficient dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>2. We may obſerve that all things are not alike <hi>indifferent.</hi> As in thoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodies, <hi>there is one Glory of the Sun, another of the Moon, &amp; another of the Stars and one Star differeth from another Star in Glory:</hi> So a great diſparity there was betwixt the State and Magnificence of the firſt and ſecond Temple, for even that which was made glorious, had no glory in this reſpect, by reaſon of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that excelleth. And to bring the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 10.</note> more cloſe to our concern; a <hi>Surplice</hi> is generally a thing indifferent; and yet, when we come to ſpecialties, who ſees not that there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt one of <hi>Cambrick</hi> and one of <hi>Canvas:</hi> and the richer it is in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue according to common eſtimation, the greater reſpect it ſhews to the perſon to whom we do therein adminiſter. And this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66530:13"/> is God's own account as well as mine; when the people made the Table of the Lord contemptible by their lame and blind Sacrifices, God upbraids them for their profane ingratitude; <hi>Offer it now unto thy Governor: will he be pleaſed with</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 7. 8.</note> 
               <hi>thee, or accept thy perſon, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts?</hi> And we muſt remember that it was the Poverty of the Offerer which God condeſcended to, when he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a pair of Turtle-doves or two young Pigeons for an Oblation; and this was only in caſe of a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who was able to preſent no more; and ſo muſt not be brought into exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when we are concerned for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Adminiſtrations. And we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider further that</p>
            <p>The eſtimate of Veneration and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence is taken from the cuſtoms of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places and Countrys: to put off our ſhooes in holy places among us would be undecent; and ſo it would be thought to kiſs the Kings hand upon our tails. Whatever they do in other places, our Governors have adjudged the Geſtures and Obſervances in uſe among us to be the moſt Reverent; and 'tis left to their judgment by Chriſt himſelf to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it; and I know no Goverment of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66530:14"/> State or Church in the World, that will lightly change their Country Cuſtoms to gratifie the deſigns or importunity of any impetuous Faction, that is crept in, or riſen up amongſt them.</p>
            <p>3. 'Tis to be conſidered that there are ſome things indifferent in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and yet there is a neceſſity for their ſpecification. And herein 'tis left to the prudence of Governors to determine. This is ſo evident of it ſelf, that the Diſſenters acknowledge it, in the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time and place. There can be no publick Adminiſtration, no ſolemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly without them; herein therefore they will allow Authority to determine.</p>
            <p>And why not as well in the matter of Habit? For to go naked is againſt the Law of natural decency; and to go in a Fools Coat is ridiculous: wherefore if Modeſty has virtue enough to make a thing neceſſary, ſome Habit ought to be appointed for publick Officers in their publick and ſolemn Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and who ſhould determine this but the Governors?</p>
            <p>And the like we may plead for our Geſture, for ſome Geſture in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Gods Worſhip and Service is of abſolute neceſſity (there can be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66530:14"/> nothing done without it) Authority therefore muſt determine; and (as was hinted even now) Holy Scripture does ſuggeſt enough for the direction of the Church herein, in the Revelation made to the Holy Evangeliſt, we find the Saints and Elders in three ſeveral po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures; they were ſitting, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 4. (2.) They were ſtanding, <hi>Rev.</hi> vii. 9, 3. they were falling down upon their knees or faces, <hi>Rev.</hi> iv. 10, &amp; 5, 8, 14. their ſitting was a poſture wherein they did attentively hear and receive the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Oracle and Inſtructions of the Goſpel (as <hi>Rev.</hi> iv. 4.) their ſtanding was, to profeſs their Faith in Chriſt and to ſing<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev. 7. 9. 10. &amp; Rev.</hi> 5. 9, 10, 11, 12. compar'd with <hi>v.</hi> 8. and 14. <hi>Rev. 4. 10. 5. 8. 14. 7. 11.</hi>
               </note> God's Praiſes: their falling down (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon their knees or faces) was to Adore and Worſhip.</p>
            <p>No doubt their behaviour was ſeemly and Reverent in all theſe ſeveral Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures or Geſtures: but ſitting (as to hear) was not ſo Reverent as ſtanding, and ſtanding (as to ſing lauds and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) was not ſo Reverent as proſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (or falling upon their knees or faces) when they offered up their prayers (<hi>Rev.</hi> v. 8.) or when they did adore and worſhip God and the Lamb, they performed it with the profoundeſt Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66530:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> and Reverence: and from this Pattern on the Mount, the Church does take and preſcribe Her practice.</p>
            <p>For kneeling at the Sacrament, the penitent and devout ſoul muſt needs be convinced that it is expedient <note n="†" place="margin">

And (2.) upon what account did he ſuffer that ſhameful and accurſed death? Was it not for our guilt? Did not God lay on him the iniquity of us all? Was he not wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions? And ſhall not this bring us upon our knees? 3. Do we not here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs our ſelves for Grace and Pardon? And ſhall we expect ſuch bleſſings upon our tails? Is it not a cuſtom with us, and do we not think it highly decent to kneel down when we kiſs our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's hand to receive a Temporal Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? For my part, when I expect to receive the greateſt bleſſings of heaven from the ever bleſſed Jeſus, by the hand of his Miniſter, to ſit then upon my taile (which may be decent enough in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66530:15"/> their conceit, who can prophane the holy Sacrament <hi>in lambs-wool</hi>) ſeems a moſt vile irreverence, and to deal freely, I cannot find in my ſelf the leaſt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to communicate at our Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in ſuch a poſture of good-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>4. We are to conſider, that where the Scripture is ſilent it is left to the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Governors to determine what things are moſt expedient; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this power there can be no Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, nothing but Diſorder and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The very firſt Convention at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> was to determine a Caſe of this nature; for the things there ſpecified<note place="margin">Acts 15. 28, 29</note> were not neceſſary antecedently to the decree of that Council. The Apoſtle commends highly ſuch as obſerved Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Ordinances of that kind,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 2. 2 Theſ. 3. 6.</note> and ſuch as did not obſerve them, He cenſures as <hi>diſorderly perſons.</hi> Indeed the ſcene of the Governors Legiſlative power lyes chiefly in expedients. For as to ſin and moral vertue, therein they are but Executors to perform the will of the Supreme Law-giver.</p>
            <p>And now, becauſe our <hi>Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler</hi> upon all or no occaſion laſhes out upon the Surplice and the ſign of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66530:16"/> the Croſs (taking no notice at all of what has been offered elſewhere in their vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication) I ſhall add a word or two more for the ſatisfaction of the ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader. How did the Saints and Elders appear before the Throne of God to the great Divine? It was in<note place="margin">Rev. 4. 4, 7, 9</note> white Robes: if they had been cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Linſey-Woolſey, a Levitical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience might have taken offence and bogled at it: but in repreſenting the ſtate of the Church and Prieſthood, in a Viſion to his beloved Diſciple and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt, we may aſſure our ſelves he would not make uſe of ſuch a Habit as were ſcandalous.</p>
            <p>And for the ſign of the Croſs (tho they cry out of many) 'tis the only Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony in all our practice of Religion; and it is but once apply'd to any ſingle perſon in his whole life, and that is done too, for the moſt part, without his conſent or knowledge (which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be his ſin) by the hand of the publick Miniſter. This is the only ſymbolical ſign we have, that is under no neceſſity and of no Divine Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet this is a real proteſtation of our Faith in Chriſt Crucified; which Faith we muſt not keep to our ſelves as we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66530:16"/> may do ſome private opinion about matters of indifferency, wherein the Church has made no determination.<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 21.</note> That this is innocent and juſtified by the practice of thoſe Tribes in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſymbolical Altar, and of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> in ſetting open his windows, (which are approved by all Divines, and by God himſelf) and that theſe very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are written for our learning we are taught by Mr. <hi>Calvin ad Dan.</hi> 6. 10. in p. 73. <hi>princ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diſcamus itaque,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; Lavater. in Librum Joſuae</hi> c. 22. p. 72. 2. m. <hi>exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum piae ſolicitudinis parentum pro filiis, &amp;c.</hi> as hath been ſufficiently declared elſewhere (tho the <hi>Reconciler</hi> thought fit to paſs it over in ſilence.)</p>
            <p>But the Presbyterians are highly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to own that proof if they will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own publick Communion and proteſted Doctrin; for in their, <hi>Jus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum Regiminis Eccleſiaſtici, pag.</hi> 16. they lay down this for a Rule in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, That the ordinary examples of the Godly approved in Scripture, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt no general precept, have the force of a general Rule, and are to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and p. 22. they ſay, Thoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in Scripture are obligatory, whoſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66530:17"/> ground, reaſon, ſcope or end are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and of a Moral Nature, and as much concern one Chriſtian as another; whether they be the examples under Old or New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Now I ſay that by a parity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the command and practice of the Church for the uſe of the ſign of the Croſs in Baptiſm is obligatory; becauſe the ground, reaſon, ſcope or end of it, which is the confeſſion of our Faith and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of our Chriſtianity, is obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and of a moral nature, and as much concern one Chriſtian as another, one Church as another, one time as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Having thus briefly ſhewed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe impoſitions, which this <hi>Reconciler</hi> does condemn; and given a ſhort account of the temper of thoſe weak Brethren on whoſe behalf he ſo earneſtly ſolicites an indulgence; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but reflect upon his Preface; wherein he does little leſs than traduce many worthy Perſons by alledging their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcentions, as if they had been the yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of a Right to thoſe Diſſenters againſt that Authority and Government, which themſelves did conſtantly aſſert and manage.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:66530:17"/>
            <p>Indeed their Charity and Compaſſion carried many of them very far that way. They ſaw us in a ſtorm; and our condition to be much like to theirs in the <hi>27th.</hi> of the <hi>Acts (15. 18, 19, 20.) When the Ship was caught</hi> (the Church aſſaulted hy a violent Faction) <hi>and could not bear up into the Wind, we let her drive. And being exceedinly toſſed with a Tempeſt, the next day they lightned the Ship: and the third day we caſt out with our own hands the takling of the Ship. And when neither Sun nor Stars, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days appeared, and no ſmall tempeſt lay on us, all hope that we ſhould be ſaved was then taken away.</hi> And this, upon the matter, was the caſe of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal and Loyal Party, who were Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued in the Eſtabliſhed Church of <hi>England;</hi> their crafty Adverſaries to raiſe a Storm againſt them, had put a conceit into the light heads of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they were bound for <hi>Rome</hi> too, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> was in another ſenſe; Hereupon their Frantick Zeal puſh'd them with an impetuous fury into Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, wherein the poor diſtreſſed Barque was ſo toſſed, She was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be ſunk, or ſplit and daſh'd to pieces. In this forlorn condition no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66530:18"/> their danger ſhould prompt them to caſt Anchor upon the unſteady ſands, or comply with any courſe or method, that might be thought expedient for their preſent ſafety. Sometimes empty Casks are thrown out by the skilfull Mariner to make diverſion for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable <hi>Leviathan,</hi> when he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens to overturn their Veſſel. And if a <hi>liberty of Propheſying</hi> be not ſufficient to divert their rage and make them at a loſs, and ſtop their cry; then an <hi>Ireni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> may be thought a pious charm to allay their heats, to appeaſe their ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities and to bring them to a more calm compoſure.</p>
            <p>Perhaps this <hi>Reconciler</hi> thinks we are in a Storm ſtill; and 'tis no wonder if he be of that opinion having taken ſo much pains to raiſe a bluſtering wind to blow up his <hi>Euroclydon</hi> of <hi>Fanatick</hi> Zeal amongſt us. But 'tis obſervable in experience, that ſuch well-meant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, at ſuch a ſeaſon, do for the moſt part give advantage to the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Adverſary, ſeldom anſwer their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and never take effect, to the obtaining that pious end, which their worthy and learned Authors aimed at.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:66530:18"/>
            <p>2. I find, that learned and good men may be miſtaken; and 'tis an error of the right hand when Charity leads them to it. We are told that Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> found occaſion to bid <hi>John Calvin</hi> good night: and whatever Eſſays of wit might come to his Friends hands when his Fancy was brisk and ſprightful, I doubt not, when he came to a more mature judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he took a ſolemn leave of many of thoſe unhappy hallucinations, which had been more to his honour, if they had been buried in his aſhes. I am ſure his Tractate of Schiſm has been confuted no leſs than three four times over. And for ſome others of a much higher rank than He, to my knowledge, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted thoſe opinions which had given ſo much encouragement to the Factious Party, and bewailed their miſtaken cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with great remorſe upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to make amends for the Scandal their well-meant tenderneſs had given to the Loyal and true Conformiſt.</p>
            <p>3. There are none of them, I dare be bold to ſay, that ever intended ſuch diſmal diſapidations of the Church as the Diſſenters had Projected, dream'd not of the introduction of ſuch confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as were the neceſſary product of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66530:19"/> their pernicious practices; and were ſo far from adhering to them in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their wicked Deſigns, that for the moſt part of them, they were ſufferers under that <hi>11th.</hi> Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>For (4.) Their conſtant Practice in the uſe of the Liturgy as it witneſſed their ſtedfaſt affection to the Church Eſtabliſhed, ſo it betrayed them to the Spight and Malice of the Faction, who were carrying on a deſign to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it. To ſay they acted herein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Judgment, would bring their ſincerity into queſtion, and make their Authority of no value, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequenty inſignificant as to that purpoſe this <hi>Reconciler</hi> produces it for. We muſt conclude therefore, that whatever their condeſcentions were, they were intended meerly to gratifie the preſent weakneſs of ſuch as they believed to be conſcientious; but not all to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance their Non-conformity.</p>
            <p>5. For Foreign Churches and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, we very well underſtand both their Principles and their Practice. And we are well aſſured that the Doctrine and the Diſcipline, the Cuſtoms and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the preſent Church of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:66530:19"/> are fully juſtified by them both; what eſteem they had for us, before the late times of Deformation we may learn from the pen of the <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>noble Deodate</hi> in his Epiſtle to the late Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; wherein he gives us this <hi>Encomium, That Flouriſhing England, the very eye and excellency of all the Churches, Chriſts own choice, purchaſe and peculiar, the Sanctuary of the afflicted, the Arcenal of the faint-hearted, the Magazine of the needy, the Royal Standard of good hope (p. 6, 7. &amp; p. 17.) He does acknowledge and ſolemnly declare it, That on the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church, the Kingdom and Church of</hi> England <hi>have hitherto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled and out-ſhined all the Churches upon Earth in Holineſs and Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such as well underſtand the happy conſtitution of this Church of <hi>England</hi> cannot but have the like value for Her; and they that are of that perſwaſion, can never with a ſober judgment and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, utter any thing in Derogation to Her Dignity. If this <hi>Reconciler</hi> can produce any thing from their example to our prejudice (tho 'tis far more fit that we ſhould be a Pattern and Law to them, than they to us) let him give us but one inſtance, wherein they deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66530:20"/> their own Eſtabliſhment to gratifie a diſcontented and Diſſenting Faction: the contrary whereof, has been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved to be the obſtinate reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Churches, as well of the <hi>Calvinian,</hi> as of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>6. I ſay, we have the Authority of many other excellent perſons of another Judgment, to name ſome few, <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift, Bancroft, Andrews, Laud, Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Hooker, Heylin, Hammond;</hi> whoſe judgments we have greater reaſon to rely upon; becauſe they judged the caſe with a more deliberate diligence, and weighed the importance and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a Change with a better attention, and by a clearer and exacter obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diſcovered more fully the temper and deſign of this Diſſenting Party. And upon this account I ſhall only ſubjoyn the Reſolutions of a Wiſe and Learned Prince with a great and prudent States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> concludes his Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion (of <hi>March</hi> 5. in the firſt of his beign) in theſe words;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We do admoniſh all men, that hereafter they ſhall not expect nor attempt any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alteration in the Common and Publick
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66530:20"/> Form of Gods Service from this which is now eſtabliſhed; for that neither will we give way for any to preſume, that our own Judgment having determined in a matter of this weight, ſhall be ſwayed to alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the frivolous ſuggeſtions of any light Spirit. Neither are we ignorant of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies that do ariſe in Government, by admitting innovation in things once ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by mature deliberation: and how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is to uſe conſtancy in the uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the publick determinatins of States; for that ſuch is the unquietneſs and unſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs of ſome diſpoſitions, affecting every year new Forms of things, as, if they ſhould be followed in their unconſtancy, would make all actions of State ridiculous and contemptible: whereas the ſtedfaſt maintaining of things by good advice eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, is the weal of all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths.</hi>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66530:21"/> win them to joyn cordially with us in the practice of the reſt, he could very well be content with it. But (his Grace added) you know Mr. <hi>W.</hi> I have ſometimes ſat at the Helm, and truly I have ſtudied the temper of theſe men, and could never find them ſo ingenuous; Aſſure your ſelf Mr. <hi>W.</hi> there is no way to Govern this ſort of People, but by a ſtraight Rein. For gratifie them in any thing, and you but encourage them to ask more. Your condeſcention ſhall be their Argument that their requiries were juſt, and your conviction that your own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is unwarrantable, nor will they ever reſt ſatisfied till all matters of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Order be laid aſide, to make way for their own (as his Grace was pleaſed to call them) new-fangled In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations.</q>

            <p>But before we proceed further I ſhall offer two or three things to the Readers ſerious Conſideration.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:66530:21"/>
            <p>1. The firſt is this, That the Church on Earth is not in a ſtate of Triumph; and though this <hi>Reconciler</hi> may be a Trimmer in a modern Notion, yet if the Bride of the Lamb wants trimming, the Diſſenters (tho they take his advice along with them) have no Authority to appoint Her Ornaments, nor are they called to be Her Dreſſers. Chriſt has taken a courſe to preſent Her to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>a Glorious Church, not having wrinkle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 27.</note> 
               <hi>ſpot or blemiſh</hi> at the day of Marriage. In the interim She is as a heap of Corn not clean winnowed from the chaff; as a field of Wheat with a mixture of Tares or Darnel: And this the Church is concerned to Tolerate, leſt She ſhould root up the Wheat for the Tares ſake, or leſt the good grain being ſeparated from the chaff before the time and ſo left na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,<note place="margin">Aug. Ep.</note> inſtead of being carried into the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, ſhould be caſt out to be pick'd up by the fouls of the Air. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another of our Lords Parables, we ſuffer the bad Fiſhes amongſt the good (till we come to the ſhore) <hi>Ne diruptis per Schiſmata retibus, dum quaſi malos piſces cavemus, in mare pernicioſae libertatis exeamus:</hi> Leſt Schiſm tearing the nets of the Church in pieces, we
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66530:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhould lanch out into the Sea of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Liberty. <q>But as the Father ſaith in another of his Epiſtles, tho the Church being ſet among much chaff and tares, tolerates many things, <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men quae ſunt contra fidem vel bonam vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, non approbat, nec tacet nec facit.</hi>
               </q> And I dare be bold to ſay, that in theſe reſpects, this Church of <hi>England</hi> is as innocent, and as eminently watchful as ever any Church was ſince the days of the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis obſervable that many well meaning Souls are ſtrangely impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the plea of a miſtaken Charity. Charity I know has in many reſpects, the ſovereignty of all vertues, and ought to have a great command in the<note place="margin">

Correction is a work of mercy as well as alms; and many times more ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and beneficial. St. <hi>Jude</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

This is ſevere you'll ſay, but 'tis no more than what we learn as well from the Practice as the Doctrine of the Apoſtle? For does he not threaten the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 2, 10.</note> with his <hi>Rod?</hi> And does he not tell them he <hi>will not ſpare,</hi> but <hi>will uſe ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and this he threatens againſt the <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> no doubt, as well as other impenitent ſinners that he ſhould find amongſt them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2.

This was ſound Doctrine and wholſom Diſcipline without queſtion in the Apoſtles time.</p>
            <p>But perhaps the caſe may be altered now; no, it was not we are ſure in St.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66530:23"/> 
               <hi>Auſtins</hi> time. <hi>Quid igitur hic faciat Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Now what remedy can the Church (which with the tenderneſs of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeks the good of all her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) apply in this caſe, whilſt ſhe is embroiled in the contentions of the Frantick on the one hand, and the Stupid and Sullen on the other? She neither can well nor indeed ought ſhe utterly to caſt them off, or ceaſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing them; which courſe ſoever ſhe takes it muſt needs trouble her, becauſe ſhe has a kindneſs for both. But ſo long as neither the Frantick and unruly will be reſtrained by her Laws, nor will the ſullen be provok'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, ſhe in charity to them both
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66530:23"/> proceeds to chaſtiſe the one and rouze up the other, and yet retains a love for them both. Both take offence, and yet what is done is in love to both; both are apt to fret and murmur, and are angry in their ſickneſs as if they were wronged, but upon recovery are glad to find the wholſom effects of thoſe means applyed to them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall trouble the Reader but with one praemonition more; which concerns the <hi>Reconcilers</hi> dealing with Dr. <hi>Womock.</hi> The Body of his diſcourſe this <hi>Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Diſſention</hi> found ſolid, and of too high proof for the little ſtrength of his Aſſault and Battery; and therefore with great wiſdom and forecaſt he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attempts it: but yet to ſhew his good will to the cauſe, and becauſe ſome ſort of men (out of their great zeal) muſt be medling, he acts the part of the <hi>old Serpent</hi> and falls a <hi>nibling</hi> at the <hi>Heels</hi> of it. <hi>But that verdict was drawn up with ſo much evidence of truth, that the Dr. dares venture it before any Bench, and preſent it to any that bears the Character and Title of a Judge, except the Proteſtant Joyner or an Ignoramus Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:66530:24"/>
            <p>With the Readers Patience, we will try how this <hi>Reconciler</hi> does attaque it. He begins, in reference to the fourteenth and fifteenth chapters of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and at <hi>pag.</hi> 89. of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. <q>Where the Dr. laid down this Poſition; That the Rules of Advice in thoſe Chapters were directions for <hi>common</hi> uſe among private Chriſtians:</q> (and here I am afraid the <hi>Reconciler</hi> had no honeſt meaning in changing the Drs. words, ſaying) <hi>and not Decrees;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Dr. goes on thus) <q>but for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> of publick uſe and practice, He (the Apoſtle) gave out none to this Church; becauſe as yet here was no Juriſdiction ſetled, no Laws made, no Governors appointed to put them in <hi>Execution.</hi>
               </q> To prove this, the Dr. alledged four Arguments, tho the <hi>Reconciler</hi> takes notice but of three.</p>
            <p>1. The firſt of thoſe Arguments was taken from <hi>Grotius,</hi> and it is built upon the Apoſtles command to thoſe <hi>Romans;</hi> which was only to mark ſuch as cauſed Diviſions and Scandals, and not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate them: From whence that Learned man collects, that there was not then at <hi>Rome</hi> any <hi>Presbytery</hi> or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Juriſdiction.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:66530:24"/>
            <p>In anſwer to this Plea, the <hi>Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 69.</note> ſaith, 1. That it is manifeſtly falſe. 2. That were it true, it alters not the caſe, nor doth it take off from the ſtrength of the preſent Argument.</p>
            <p>But to mollifie the ſharpneſs of his ſtile, in ſaying, 'tis manifeſtly falſe, he is pleaſed to be a little more civil (and that is much in him) and to ſay, only 1. That it is not true; <q>For (ſays he) can any man imagine (yes, he knows, <hi>Grotius,</hi> and <hi>Aretius,</hi> and <hi>others</hi> as well as Dr. <hi>Womock,</hi> do imagine it) that in ſuch a Church, whoſe Faith was ſpoken of throughout the World, there ſhould be no Miniſters to Baptize, to Preach the Word, to adminiſter the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to them? and if there were ſuch, there muſt be a ſtanding Order of Presbyters licenſed by the Apoſtles or their Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op, or exerciſing their Miniſterial Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction without licence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Before I return my Anſwer, I muſt in Charity deliver the <hi>Reconciler</hi> out of his own ſnare, or at leaſt preſerve the unwary Reader from it: <hi>or exerciſing their Miniſterial Function without Licence:</hi> This is a fallacy, which the <hi>Logicians</hi> call <hi>petitio principii:</hi> whether there were
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66530:25"/> ſuch a Miniſterial Function ſetled as yet at <hi>Rome,</hi> is the thing in queſtion: but the <hi>Reconciler</hi> takes it for granted, and ſo diſputes upon it. He ſhould have proved it firſt, and then he might very fairly have made his Inference. In the mean while, I ſhall tell the Reader for his ſatisfaction,</p>
            <p>That <hi>Rome</hi> being the Imperial City, and having Commerce with all the World, 'twas no wonder that all the world ſhould ſoon have intelligence that the Goſpel was brought and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained amongſt them.</p>
            <p>But as a very <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>judicious perſon</hi> obſerves, the Church (or rather the Chriſtians) at <hi>Rome,</hi> when S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtle thither, ſeems (as that alſo at <hi>Antioch</hi> was) for the moſt part to be made up of <hi>Foreigners</hi> (both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi>) whom buſineſs<note place="margin">Acts 28. 17. Rom. 1. 15. 16.</note> drew thither from other converted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces) as appears both from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſalutations of former Acquaintance<note place="margin">

               </note> (chap. 16.) and from his writing the Epiſtle in <hi>Greek.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the Sacraments were as yet commonly adminiſtred there, is not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in that Epiſtle, (for the mention of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in the ſixth Chapter, will
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66530:25"/> not evince it, that it was) but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> could not want <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> in a large ſenſe, to publiſh it. The <hi>good women,</hi> who brought the glad tidings of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> return from the Grave with life and glory, are ſomewhere ſtiled <hi>Apoſtolorum Apoſtolae,</hi> the Apoſtles of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
            <p>After the death of S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> the Diſciples who were ſcattered abroad,<note place="margin">Acts 8. 4.</note> went every where Preaching the Word. But were all Apoſtles properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? Had all power to Plant and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh and Govern Churches? This <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 5.</note> knows the <hi>Goſpel was Preached</hi> in <hi>Creete</hi> before any <hi>Diſcipline</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> was <hi>eſtabliſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> tell us, with great truth and reaſon that <hi>Poteſtas Ordinis, &amp; Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtas Juriſdictionis</hi> are too ſeveral things.

            <p>Every mans zeal and knowledge (where there is no <hi>Organical Church</hi> ſetled) was licence enough for him to report what had been done at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and what was the preſent Faith and Practice there. If they had any Miniſters to Preach <hi>with Authority</hi> amongſt them, no doubt they had their <hi>Holy Orders</hi> and a <hi>Divine Miſſion,</hi> and were put in Office to that purpoſe; but 'tis moſt likely they had none; becauſe tho they had knowledge to admoniſh one another of the Doctrine they had received, yet they had no <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to <hi>teach</hi> as S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> has obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Rom. 15. 14. non dixit, ut invicem ſe doceant, ſed admoneant;</hi> and if there had been any ſuch ſpiritual guides, doubtleſs, in ſuch a caſe of difficulty and danger, the Apoſtle would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Chriſtians to their Conduct as he did in other places.</p>
            <p>And yet every man that hath a licence as well as ability to preach the Goſpel, has not preſently the Authority of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor. <hi>Philip</hi> was an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> and Preached Chriſt to the City of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:66530:26"/> Baptiz'd Converts, and wrought Miracles amongſt them, yet he had no Juriſdiction there. The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to lay their hands upon them to Confirm them, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 14. to 17.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſaith our <hi>Reconciler,</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle among many others, whom he calls his <hi>Helpers</hi> in <hi>Chriſt, approved in Chriſt, labourers in Chriſt. Rom.</hi> 16. 3, 9, 12. who may all rationally be deemed to be Church-Officers (and as rationally deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be none) <hi>Presbyters, Deacons,</hi> and <hi>Diaconeſſes,</hi> makes mention of <hi>Androni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> and <hi>Junias,</hi> of note amongſt Chriſt's Apoſtles, <hi>i. e.</hi> (ſaith our <hi>Reconciler</hi>) among the Preachers of the Goſpel, the Teachers of the Chriſtian Faith. If theſe be his <hi>Church-Governors,</hi> then there was a <hi>woman</hi> got into the <hi>Chair</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pope Joan</hi> was heard of; for <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philact</hi> ſaith that <hi>Junias</hi> was the name of a <hi>woman,</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks ſhe was <hi>wife</hi> to <hi>Andronicus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is all this to a ſetled Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, to eſtabliſht Laws, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors appointed to put them in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which was the thing he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to prove? and now to pay him back a little of his own coin (of the finer mettal,) who could imagine this <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:66530:27"/> would have had the confidence to oppoſe a <hi>deliberate Verdict</hi> upon a <hi>Melius inquirendum;</hi> and pretermitting all the ſolid Grounds of Truth, Reaſon and Authority, upon which it is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, think to quaſh it by his own vain Imaginations?</p>
            <p>All the Ancients that write of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do conclude that it was founded by thoſe two great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> being the Apoſtle of the <hi>Incircumciſion,</hi> and above all the reſt adorned with the title of a choſen veſſel to bear the name and Goſpel of Chriſt among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 15. in all reaſon we ſhould allow him a good ſhare in the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Church which was the moſt conſiderable in his whole <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;</hi> but 'tis evident when he wrote his Epiſtle he had never been at <hi>Rome</hi> to do it; and tho he ſent <hi>Phaebe</hi> with his Epiſtle, I hope no man will be ſo ill adviſed as to think he gave her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Commiſſion to Govern.</p>
            <p>If there had been any ſuch Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors there, where ſhould we look for them, but among thoſe perſons (of ſuch excellent note) whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſalutes; and yet if the <hi>Reconciler</hi> will
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66530:27"/> needs have them to be Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, the firſt of the Catalogue is a <hi>Woman, (Rom. 16. 3.) Priſcilla,</hi> ſo likewiſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 19. She is called <hi>Priſca,</hi> and ſet before <hi>Aquila,</hi> and 'tis thought (what e're the reſt were) that her <hi>Husband</hi> was <hi>her Convert. Priſcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam quidem priori loco ponit, cujus ratio certa vix reddi poteſt. Si tamen conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris locus eſt, illuſtrior fortuſſis fuit uxor, &amp; magis nota omnibus, vel prior ad fidem converſa maritum poſtea inſtituit. Gualt. ad Rom. Homil.</hi> 93. in p. 225. 2. in fine. <q>He ſets down <hi>Priſcilla</hi> in the firſt place, for which no certain Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given; but if we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, probably the Wife might be of the more honourable extraction, and ſo more publickly known, or being firſt converted to the Faith her ſelf, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards inſtructed her Husband in the ſame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That S. <hi>Peter</hi> was there to plant a Church and ſettle Governors, ſo as to make a Coalition of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one united body, before S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle, if he can prove it ſolidly, the preſent <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall thank him for it: but the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Proteſtant Writers are againſt it.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66530:28"/> Take <hi>Gualterus</hi> inſtead of all the reſt, <hi>ad Rom, 16. 7, 16. Homil. 94. Non parum facit hic locus ad confutandum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudens Papiſtarum figmentum, &amp;c.</hi> 
               <q>This place (ſaith he) makes ſtrongly for the confutation of that impudent Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Papiſts, who dream of S. <hi>Peters</hi> coming to <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and that he firſt conſtituted a Church there, over which he himſelf did preſide for five and twenty years together. Now if they ſay true in this, He muſt be at <hi>Rome</hi> when S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrought this Epiſtle. Why then makes he no mention of him? or what reaſon can be alledged why the name of <hi>Peter</hi> only ſhould be left out of that long and honourable catalogue of thoſe men who were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in that Church at that time? was it becauſe he was ignorant of his being there? But this cannot well be, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Faith of <hi>Rome</hi> was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in moſt parts of the World; and how could ſo great an Apoſtle eſcape S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s knowledge, who was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo many of far meaner quality? or ſhall we think that he concealed S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s name out of emulation? But far be ſuch a thing from the ſincerity
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66530:28"/> and uprightneſs of an Apoſtle; and why ſhould he envy <hi>Peter</hi> his honour who ſpeaks ſo honourably of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers far inferior to him? Therefore our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will never be able to make good this fancy of theirs. For what Anſwer will they give S. <hi>Luke,</hi> who ſays that <hi>Peter</hi> was preſent at the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth in his ſecond Chapter to the <hi>Galathians</hi>) was held in the eighteenth year after his Converſion, which (according to true computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) falls on the ninth year of <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us?</hi> beſides theſe men are not aware how great miſchief they do S. <hi>Peter,</hi> when they talk of his ſitting as Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for full five and twenty years, who (according to Chriſts command) ought to have travelled up and down and preached the Goſpel in ſeveral places. And truly if (with other Hiſtories) we compare thoſe places which are found in ſacred Scripture, we ſhall find that thoſe later Writers who queſtioned S. <hi>Peters</hi> ever being at <hi>Rome</hi> at all, had ſome ſhew of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for their conjecture. But becauſe this may ſeem ſomewhat difficult to prove by reaſon of the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66530:29"/> of Ancient Writers, who affirm that he ſuffered Martyrdom at <hi>Rome</hi> in the laſt year of <hi>Nero,</hi> I ſhall eaſily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto that.

A Corintho Civitate Metropoli A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaiae Regionis Scripſit Apoſtolus Paulus Romanis hanc Epiſtolam, quos non ipſe, non Petrus, non Quilibet Apoſtolorum duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cim primum inſtruxit, ſed quidam Judaeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum credentium, qui ab Hieroſolymis Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam venientes (ubi Princeps Orbis reſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, cui erant ipſi Subjecti) fidem, quam apud Hieroſolymam didicerunt, Romanis Evangelizaverunt:</hi> 
               <q>From the City <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> the Metropolis of all <hi>Achaia</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writ this Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who were inſtructed in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtianity neither by <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, nor <hi>Peter,</hi> nor yet by any of the twelve Apoſtles,</q> but ſome of the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> who came from <q>
                  <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> (which was the ſeat of the Emperor, whoſe Subjects they were) and made known that Faith to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66530:29"/> the <hi>Romans</hi> which they had learned at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soto</hi> is of opinion that when S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſent his Epiſtle to <hi>Rome,</hi> They had not ſo much as heard of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Viſion at <hi>Joppa, (Act.</hi> 10.) which is an argument that he had not ſpent ſo much time there as ſome imagine. And truly I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſwade my ſelf that S. <hi>Peter</hi> had not been there at all, before that time, than think he carried himſelf among them, as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſays he had done at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, Petrus ita Judaizabat, ut Gentes cogeret in ſervitutem: &amp; ſimul hoc quaſi praejudicio derogaret Pauli Doctrinae.

               <q>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> did ſo far com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he had almoſt brought the <hi>Gentiles</hi> under the ſlavery of the Law: and likewiſe hereby gave ſo great offence to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that it took off very much from the force and efficacy of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine. So that herein he exceeded the bounds of his Commiſſion, becauſe he apply'd his care more in gratifying ſome few than in edifying the whole Church,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66530:30"/> and regarded more the pleaſing of one part, the <hi>Jews,</hi> than the benefit and expedience of the whole Body.</q> And again, <hi>ad verſe 14. Ideo claudicationis arguitur quia nimis ſerviliter Judaeis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequebatur,</hi> 
               <q>Calvin <hi>ad Gal.</hi> 2. 14. therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> reproves him of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteadineſs and wavering in his opinion becauſe he ſaw him ſo ſervilely comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant with the <hi>Jews.

               <q>
                  <hi>Aret. ad Gal.</hi> 2. S. <hi>Paul</hi> thought it very neceſſary to rebuke him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe through his means the Goſpel ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered very much in its credit and repute, as though it ſtood in need of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi> obſervances to ſuſtain it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At the beſt, when this Epiſtle was ſent, we are ſure there was not ſufficient Authority at <hi>Rome</hi> to quell the <hi>Faction,</hi> or ſuppreſs thoſe <hi>Impoſtors</hi> and <hi>falſe Teachers</hi> who were the <hi>Fomenters</hi> of it: But S <hi>Pauls</hi> own perſonal preſence was needful to this effect, with the fulneſs of his <hi>Apoſtolical Endowments</hi> and the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Miracles,</hi> as we ſhall ſhew anon.</p>
            <p>In the mean while it will appear thoſe little Arguments (as the <hi>Reconciler</hi> is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:66530:30"/> pleaſed to undervalue them) collected out of <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Catharinus</hi> are of ſo great force to the purpoſe for which they were produced, that all his little Cavils or Exceptions, upon examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be of no moment to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>His exceptions</hi> are theſe.</p>
            <p>1. That Exhortation. <hi>Mark them which cauſe Diviſions and avoid them</hi> (Rom. 16. 17.) he ſays, is parallel to that in 2 <hi>Theſs. 3. 6, 14. if any man obey not our word, note that man, withdraw your ſelves from every Brother that walks diſorderly.</hi> If this be all he can ſay, we ſhall grant it to him, and ſo does the learned <hi>Grotius;</hi> who makes the caſe exactly parallel; His words are theſe, <hi>Si Presbyterium ibi fuiſſet, juſſiſſet eos ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicari, plane quia Presbyterium non erat, juſſit tales improbe viventes vitari, id eſt, familiarem eorum conſuetudinem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugi, quod jus ſingulis Chriſtianis compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit, (Grot. ad 2 Theſ.</hi> 3. 6.) <q>If there had been Governors and a Juriſdiction ſetled there, he would have commanded to have been excommunicated (thoſe who lived wickedly and diſorderly:) But becauſe as yet there were no ſuch Governors or Juriſdiction, He only enjoyns them to avoid familiar conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66530:31"/> with them, which is a right that belongs to all Chriſtians.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, ſays our <hi>Reconciler,</hi> that there were then <hi>Church-Governors</hi> among the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> is evident from chap. 5. 12, 13. why he did not name the Epiſtle, He knows beſt, but I can gueſs: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he would have had us ſwallow it, that it was in the very ſame Epiſtle: But it is in that which we call the firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>we beſeech you Brethren to know them which labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you, and to eſteem them very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their work-ſake.</hi> Here indeed it ſeems there was a <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> and <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors</hi> ſetled to execute it. But this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler</hi> knows very well, that S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles are not placed in our Bibles, in the ſame order they were written in; <hi>The Epiſtle</hi> which we call the <hi>firſt,</hi> was written after that, which goes, among us, for the <hi>ſecond;</hi> The <hi>learned Grotius</hi> has given us his reaſons for it, as well in his Preface upon 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. as in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother learned and judicious Treatiſe (in the firſt volume of his works) to which he refers his Reader. And 'tis worth our obſervation, That, writing to them when there were no Governors
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66530:31"/> ſetled among them to overſee and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect emergent miſcarriages, He makes uſe of his <hi>Apoſtolical Authority</hi> to oblige them to do as he ſhould think fit to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 12, 14.</note> and Order. <hi>We command and exhort by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that if any man obey not our word</hi> (of command) <hi>ſignifie that Man by an Epiſtle,</hi> that according to the Character you ſhall give of him, I may decree what is fit to be done to him, (or what Diſcipline he ought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go:) In the interim (if his Offence be Scandalous) <hi>have no familiar converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him, that he may</hi> (if poſſible) <hi>be ſhamed into Reformation;</hi> But when there were Governors ſetled, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle alters his ſtyle to them: 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12, 13. after he had admoniſhed the Diſciples to have a ſpecial regard to thoſe Spiritual Guides, and a high va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue for them; He treats them with great reſpect, when he puts them in mind of their Duty, <hi>Now we beſeech you Brethren, warn them that are diſorderly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Reconciler</hi> goes on with his exceptions and tells us, <q>The ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle writing to <hi>Timothy</hi> concerning ſuch who had a Form of Godlineſs but denied the power of it, writes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of Perſons, who did as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66530:32"/> the Churches Cenſures as thoſe he mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. (This <hi>Reconciler</hi> always has a reſerve of kindneſs for ſuch as make Diviſions, and Diſſentions in the Church) and <hi>Timothy</hi> ſays he, to whom he writes, had power to inflict thoſe Cenſures, and yet he only ſaith unto him, <hi>from ſuch turn away,</hi> The place is 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But to this I reply. 1. That no doubt <hi>Timothy</hi> (after ſo long converſe with this great Apoſtle) very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the ſeveral parts of his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and the Apoſtle did not think fit to preſcribe him particular Rules of Government, having charged him, in the General, in his former E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, chap. 5. 21. To proceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the merits of every cauſe that ſhould be brought before him, and <hi>to do nothing with Partiality.</hi> 2. He ſpeaks there of a dangerous ſort of Impoſtors, which crept into Houſes and had cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning enough to lead Captive ſilly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and ſuch falſe Apoſtles as take ſanctuary in great Families, the Church-Cenſures cannot always reach them: <hi>Timothy</hi> had not then the aſſiſtance of a Secular arm, and perhaps they were not to be reſtrained without it.</p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:66530:32"/>
            <p>3. The Apoſtle forſeaw the <hi>Reign</hi> of thoſe <hi>Impoſtors</hi> would be but ſhort; and concluded it would be moſt prudent to let them alone to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to contempt and ſcorn, to their own ruin, and this is the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of thoſe words, (2 <hi>Tim. 3. 9.) They ſhall proceed no further: for their folly ſhall be manifeſt unto all men,</hi> as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps our <hi>Reconcilers</hi> miſadventure may be ere he be few months older. But this ſhall ſuffice for the vindication of <hi>Grotius</hi> his <hi>little Argument.</hi> The next Argument was that of <hi>Catharinus;</hi> it was but ſhort indeed; and the <hi>Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> was too ſhort-ſighted to diſcern the force of it, 'twas taken from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles expoſtulation, <hi>who art thou that judgeſt another mans Servant? Cum non ſis Paſtor, aut Dominus ejus;</hi> as <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> very truly and judiciouſly makes the ſenſe of the Apoſtle; <q>when thou art not his Lord or Biſhop and haſt no juriſdiction and command over him.</q> This Argument ſaith our <hi>Reconciler</hi> is extremely frivolous; (which argues he does not underſtand it) for (ſaith he) <q>if this be the import of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles words, why doſt thou judge ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Servant, who art not his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66530:33"/> Paſtor, then his own Maſter, to whom he ſtands, or falls, muſt be his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor; and therefore he muſt have a Paſtor. But the Maſter there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is ſo plainly God, that it is but loſt time to prove it. Thus our <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler</hi> argues.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But under favour he has inſnared himſelf in a <hi>Fallacy,</hi> which is called <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noratio Elenchi;</hi> For the Aſſertion was this, that thoſe Rules were given to private Perſons; and the reaſon of that were becauſe there was no <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors</hi> then ſetled among the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the proof of this was taken from a hint in <hi>Catharinus;</hi> why doſt thou judge thy Brother? <hi>cum non ſis Paſtor aut Dominus ejus:</hi> He had no Biſhop or Paſtor to Govern him in Church-matters; and therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle refers him to God's Tribunal.</p>
            <p>And now I hope the Argument will be clear to the underſtanding of our <hi>Reconciler,</hi> for thus it is framed; They that were accountable to none but God (in matters of Religion) They were under no Juriſdiction; they who were under no Juriſdiction had no Governors, and conſequently theſe directions could not concern them, who were not then
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66530:33"/> in Being, eſpecially being a Proviſion for quietneſs, deſign'd for want of them.</p>
            <p>And here it will not be impertinent to take notice of <hi>Aquinas</hi> his obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (in <hi>Prol.</hi>) That S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Epiſtles, <q>whereof nine were to inſtruct the Church of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> four to direct the Prelates and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Church, and one for the Inſtruction of the People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For the whole Doctrine concerns the Grace of Chriſt, which falls under a threefold conſideration. One way, as it is in Chriſt the Head, and ſo it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us in the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews.</hi> Another way as it is in the Principal Members of the Body Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and ſo it is commended in thoſe Epiſtles which are directed to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. A third way as it is in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body it ſelf, which is the Church; and ſo it is commended in thoſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, which were ſent to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> amongſt which this to the <hi>Romans</hi> was one, and not directed to the Prelates of the Church, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And it is further obſervable, That here are Rules given (and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the 14th and 15th Chapters)
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66530:34"/> which are inconſiſtent with the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors Duty;</hi> For (1.) He paſſeth by the <hi>Biſhops Office,</hi> and applies himſelf to the <hi>Diſciples;</hi> and inſtead of giving order to the firſt to excommunicate the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous offenders, He requires the other to avoid them. (2.) He forbids <hi>judging,</hi> which had been an obſtruction of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Diſcipline, if there had been any Officers to execute and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. (3.) As he had done by the Women in another ſence, ſo here he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns the Men ſilence, to keep their Faith, their Opinion and Knowledge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which in <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Paſtors</hi> was an <hi>obſtructing</hi> of <hi>Edification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis clear S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſends them a <hi>Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi> againſt <hi>Judging:</hi> but this we may be ſure S. <hi>Paul</hi> would not have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as had <hi>Authority</hi> to Judge; whence it will follow, That he ſent not this <hi>prohibition</hi> to <hi>Church-Governors,</hi> and from hence it will follow that there were none ſuch amongſt them, which was the thing undrtaken to be proved as was hinted by <hi>Catharinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Argument may be put into Form thus: Such as have a <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> and <hi>Divine Authority</hi> to <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Scandals,</hi> and <hi>Offences,</hi> thoſe Perſons the Apoſtle
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:66530:34"/> did not forbid to <hi>judge;</hi> the reaſon is becauſe the holy Apoſtle doubtleſs would not ſuperſede a <hi>Divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and obſtruct the courſe of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Reformation.</hi> But <hi>Governors</hi> (where they were duly ſetled) had a <hi>Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>Divine Authority</hi> to judge of <hi>Scandals</hi> and <hi>Offences;</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle did not forbid them to <hi>Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are but two things to be made good, to clear the Argument from all poſſible objection. (1.) That there were among thoſe Chriſtians at <hi>Rome, many Miſdemeanors, Scandals and Offences, matters fit for Inquiſition and Cenſure.</hi> 2. That Church-Governors had Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (where they were duly ſetled) to inquire into them and Cenſure them. The firſt is clearly proved from the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 16. 17. Mark them which cauſe Diviſions and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences and avoid, &amp;c.</hi> Had there not been ſuch Perſons among them, they could neither have been obſerved nor avoided, <hi>Non quod condemnatione digna non agat, ne ipſum judices;</hi> he does not forbid judging upon this account, becauſe he had done nothing worthy of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as <hi>Bruno,</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact</hi>
               <note place="margin">

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66530:35"/> And among the beſt of thoſe weak ones the Apoſtle was ſo tender of, there were faults enough to be blamed: (1.) Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of that Liberty wherewith Chriſt had made them free: (2.) <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition</hi> in adhering ſo ſtifly to the Ritual Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and (3.) <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> of <hi>Authority</hi> to Cenſure and Condemn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who were better Chriſtians than themſelves.</p>
            <p>Here was matter enough for the <hi>Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance</hi> of a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Judicature:</hi> but <hi>Authority</hi> was wanting; there were no <hi>Governors</hi> eſtabliſht; for had there been ſuch they had had power to judge; which is the ſecond thing that is to be proved; And for this we can look no where but we may be furniſhed with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> for what was the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Keys</hi> given by Chriſt to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but a <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>bind</hi> and <hi>looſe,</hi> to <hi>Inquire</hi> and <hi>Judge.</hi> And having made <hi>Timothy</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and ſet him to Govern there; He inſtructs him what to do in point of Judicature: 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 19, 20.

            <p>This was the very fault that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned here by this Apoſtle, that they Judged without Authority, and ſo <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Dicſon</hi> underſtands it, <hi>Iniquum eſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienum ſervum ſine vocatione à Deo judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care:</hi> 'Tis a wicked thing to judge ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans ſervant without a Call and Authority from God to do it; How da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thou challenge the right to thy ſelf, when thou haſt no Law of the Lord for it?

            </p>
            <p>But has not this <hi>Reconciler</hi> taken a great deal of pains to make himſelf a <hi>tranſgreſſor,</hi> and does he not teach the People to arraign their Governors? And to give a good example for it, he ſets himſelf up a <hi>Tribunal,</hi> and treats his <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi> as if they were his Servants and under his <hi>Juriſdiction.</hi> What ſaith S. <hi>James? He that ſpeaketh evil of his Brother, and judgeth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſpeaketh evil of the Law, and Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Law;</hi> (ſo he does by conſequence) <hi>but if thou judge the Law, thou art not a Doer of the Law, but a Judge. (Jam.</hi> 4. 11.) Now this <hi>Reconciler</hi> does directly ſpeak evil of his Governors and the Law too, and does freely Judge and Condemn them both, and conſequently
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66530:37"/> he's not a Doer of the Law but a Judge. He ſhould do well to learn what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays to his weak Brothers <hi>Cenſure. (Rom. 2. 21, 22.) Thou which teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf? Thou that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt a man ſhould not ſteal doſt thou ſteal? Thou that ſaiſt a man ſhould not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery, doſt thou commit Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Thou that ſayſt a man ſhould not judge, doſt thou judge? Thou that abhorreſt Idols, doſt thou commit Sacrilege?</hi> He robs his Governors of their Authority, which is Sacred, and uſurps it to himſelf, for while he diſputes ſo fiercely againſt judging in his ſuperiors, he does not ſtick to judge them, to cenſure their Laws, and condemn their <hi>Innocent Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</hi> If it be never Lawful for the Chriſtian, of what degree or rank ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be, to judge the Perſon whom God has received, to walk uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably towards his Brother (as he ſaith p. 72.) much leſs to carry himſelf thus towards his Superiors; why then does he ſo raſhly and inſolently judge his Governors? either he thinks God hath not received them, and then he walks uncharitably towards them; or elſe he believes God has received them; and then his judging of them (beſides
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66530:37"/> the incivility and ſawcineſs of it) is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful by his own Rule; and ſo he is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> like the Heretick (<hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10.) condemned at his own Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
            <p>But 'tis nothing with him to break his own Rules, we ſhall find him at it again in handling the next Argument, which the Dr. confeſſeth he had not the leaſt hint of from any Author, but took it upon truſt from the words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. <hi>Haſt thou Faith? have it to thy ſelf before God. Rom.</hi> 14. 22. From which words the Doctor would infer, <q>That there were no Governers then ſetled over the Chriſtians who were at <hi>Rome;</hi>
               </q> For had there been a Biſhop there, it had been the duty of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his charge in any matter of Heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to have conſulted him to reſolve their Doubts and ſettle their perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To this the <hi>Reconciler</hi> is pleaſed to anſwer by a double quere.</p>
            <p>1. Why may not he who hath Faith have it to himſelf, that is, forbear act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to his full perſuaſion of his Liberty, or divulging his opinion to his Brothers prejudice, as well if he had twenty Biſhops over him, as if he had none? (2.) Why might not S. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:66530:38"/> adviſe without conſulting of his Biſhop? I ſhall anſwer to his laſt quere firſt, to which I ſay,</p>
            <p>1. If S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s advice might ſatisfie when they had it, yet it could not ſatisfie (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) when they had it not. But (2.) among Diſſenting Perſons there will be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand emergent Doubts and Scruples, which an Apoſtle can no more prevent or anſwer than he can foreſee them at ſuch a diſtance; which S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. laſt.</note> thinks to be the Reaſon why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle reſerved the correcting of ſome things among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> till his coming to them.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond <hi>quere</hi> the Dr. gave his reſolution in the Verdict, p. 125. That Chriſtian Liberty is a Spiritual Privilege, and ſeated in the Soul, and may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved there in ſilence.</p>
            <p>But what the <hi>Reconciler</hi> has ſaid to this Argument is nothing to the purpoſe: He is again inſnared in the common Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy (<hi>Ignoratio Elenchi</hi>) but while the Dr. ſtudied brevity he might be obſcure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

For I have not ſhun'd to declare unto you the whole Counſel of God;</hi> whereof doubtleſs the Truth and <hi>Priviledge</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Liberty was a part.</p>
            <p>And now I hope the <hi>Reconciler</hi> will be able to underſtand the Drs. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from thoſe words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, which may be framed after this manner,</p>
            <p>They who have a <hi>Divine Authority</hi> and command to reſolve <hi>Doubts</hi> and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Conſcience</hi> about things indifferent, They are not forbidden by the Apoſtle to reſolve and ſettle them; For then he ſhould take them off from their <hi>Duty</hi> and obſtruct <hi>Edification.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:66530:39"/>
            <p>But <hi>Church-Governors</hi> have a <hi>Divine Authority</hi> to reſolve <hi>doubts,</hi> and ſettle <hi>Conſcience</hi> about things <hi>indifferent;</hi>
            </p>

            <p>This his interpretation of that Chap. and Text, takes off all obligation from <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Governors</hi> to attempt the <hi>Recovering</hi> of a <hi>Roman-Catholick;</hi> Nay it makes the attempt unlawful.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66530:40"/> towards him in ſo doing; yea verily, I ſhould put a ſtumbling-block in his way, and tempt him to forbear that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice againſt his <hi>Conſcience;</hi> and in ſo doing I ſhould ſin againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and deſtroy a <hi>Brother</hi> for whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> died. This I ought not to do, and tho I be otherwiſe perſwaded in my own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ordained and put in truſt to teach the Goſpel, yet I muſt herein fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the advice of the Apoſtle: <hi>Haſt thou Faith? have it to thy ſelf before God.</hi> I will therefore accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to keep my Faith and Opinion to my ſelf and not diſturb a <hi>weak Brother:</hi> and ſo the poor man muſt periſh (if God be not the more merciful unto him) in his Error and Superſtition.</p>
            <p>Whereas the good Paſtor does other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; He tells him, Sir you live in a dangerous Error; and tho the <hi>times</hi> you obſerve and the <hi>meats</hi> you eat be very <hi>indifferent</hi> in themſelves, yet your practice in the uſe of them is very <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the practice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> I pray Sir, be you better adviſed, and harken to the Holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that you may recover your ſelf out of the power of Satan, who
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66530:40"/> by the crafty inſinuations of bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments has taken you Captive in the ſnare of Superſtition.</p>
            <p>Thus a <hi>Conſcientious Prelate</hi> would behave himſelf; but our <hi>Reconciler,</hi> has taught himſelf a more ſaving Doctrine to ſerve his Intereſt in times of Danger. And doubtleſs the man would make a very <hi>Prudential Governor</hi> in a juncture of ſome difficulty; For if a Demure <hi>Faction</hi> ſhould ferment in his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and ſwell up into a <hi>Sedition</hi> for <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſake, if he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, comply, and cunningly encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage it, he would at leaſt wiſely ſhut his mouth, and (to be ſure) not utter a word to <hi>check</hi> the <hi>wicked practice;</hi> and he would have the confidence to ſay, that he learned this <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Neutrality</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, if he learnt it there, why did he not practice it? If he thought the <hi>ſign</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> or the <hi>uſe</hi> of the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice,</hi> or <hi>kneeling</hi> at the <hi>Sacrament inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient</hi> and burdenſom, and the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of them more than the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Superiors could juſtifie, why did he not follow his own Rule and keep his faith to himſelf? 'Tis a wiſe mans advice, (<hi>Eccleſ. 19. 10.) If thou
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66530:41"/> haſt heard a word, let it die with thee, and be bold, it will not burſt thee.</hi> The advice is as wiſe for an Opinion as for a Word; and if his opinion had died with him, the Funeral would not have been ſo chargeable to him as the <hi>Chriſtening</hi> of it.

            <p>But to follow the ſteps of our <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler,</hi> 
               <q>He ſays ſecondly, had there been then no Church-Governors in the whole <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> had they been deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of any <hi>Miniſters</hi> for <hi>publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> this will not in the leaſt abate the ſtrength of what we argue hence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Dr. dares aſſert that the <hi>Church-Governors</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:66530:41"/> were not as much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Reaſon here laid down, as were the <hi>Common People;</hi> that is, that they were not obliged to <hi>receive the weak in Faith, v.</hi> 1. and <hi>being ſtrong to bear the infirmities of the weak,</hi> Chap. 15. 1. that they might judge another mans ſervant, v. 4. that they might put a ſtumbling-block, or an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to fall in their Brothers way, v. 13. That they might walk uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably, might grieve, and even deſtroy him with their meat for whom Chriſt died, v. 15. that they might let their good be evil ſpoken of, v. 16. and might for meat deſtroy the work of God. And that tho it is good for private perſons not to eat fleſh, nor drink wine, nor to do any thing whereby their Brother ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth, or is offended, or is made weak; yet may Church-Governors impoſe ſuch things, although God hath declared that their power is only for Edification, and not for Deſtruction, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 10.) What therefore do men gain by ſaying, Theſe Precepts were directed to private Perſons, and not to Church-Governors; ſince it is certain that they do more eſpecially concern them, whoſe work it is to build up ſouls, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the greateſt charity towards them,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:66530:42"/> than any private Perſons in the world. Add to this laſtly, That S. <hi>Paul</hi> was certainly a Church-Governor who had as much power as any of his Succeſſors in theſe matters; and yet he was ſo far from varying from theſe Rules that chiefly he confirms them from his own example.</q> Thus our <hi>Reconciler.</hi>

And being pious as well as ſtrong, They are willing alſo to bear their <hi>Infirmities;</hi> and not only to bear with them, which is the part of every

               <hi>private Chriſtian;</hi> but to heal them, which is the part of every good <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician:</hi> To bear them as our <hi>bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> bare our ſins; not ſo as to take them upon his ſhoulders only, but to bear and carry them quite away; and this is their Labour of Love and work of Charity: But they cannot do this in effect (no more could our Lord himſelf) unleſs the People be willing to part with them.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>who art thou that judgeſt another mans Servant,</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle? and may a <hi>Church-Governor</hi> do this? Why not? He is in <hi>Authority,</hi> and doubtleſs he may <hi>Judge,</hi> where God hath called him to that Office, and given him a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction for it. Nay, I ſay he muſt do it; for what ſaith the Lord to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet? <hi>Jer. 15. 19. If thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou ſhalt be as my mouth.</hi> This is that the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of a <hi>good Governor, Nempè ut condemnet libere quicquid vitioſum eſt, &amp; fortiter defendat quod rectum eſt, etiamſi totus mundus repugnet,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place; That he freely condemn whatſoever is vitious, and as ſtoutly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend what is right and juſt, tho the whole World ſhould oppoſe it.

            <p>They may not deſpiſe or ſet at nought a <hi>Weak Brother;</hi> but I hope, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with a juſt Authority, you will allow them to reprove and upbraid ſuch as are <hi>wilfully ignorant,</hi> upon a <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine Careleſneſs</hi> or ſomething worſe.

            <p>But ſo far are they from putting a ſtumbling-block or an occaſion to fall in their Brothers way; that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to put him into the right way, wherein (if he has eyes in his head, and will follow their Direction) he ſhall be ſure not to ſtumble. But when our Superiours they have made the way
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66530:46"/> plain and ſmooth, and eaſie, according to the truth of the Goſpel. If ſuch as this <hi>Reconciler</hi> ſhall throw in their <hi>Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> of <hi>offence</hi> to obſtruct it, and then theſe Brethren will daſh their foot willingly againſt it and ſtumble at it, Their Fall is willful, and they muſt thank themſelves for the hurt they take by it.</p>
            <p>I deny not but Governors in ſome ſenſe, are concerned to pleaſe the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: But a man may pleaſe others both to his own, and to their <hi>deſtruction</hi> (as <hi>Theod. ad Rom.</hi> 15. 1.) I muſt not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie him in his <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Sedition</hi> to pleaſe him; for that would betray him to damnation. I muſt pleaſe him only to his good, to his edification, in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Goſpel, that he may be ſaved, to this end it may be a <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors Duty</hi> to grieve him. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2: for there is a <hi>godly ſorrow, which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth repentance unto ſalvation not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of.</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10.) And he that can bring a ſoul to this, tho his methods may ſeem ſevere, yet among wiſe and ſober Chriſtians his <hi>Diſcipline</hi> as well as his <hi>Liberty</hi> will be well ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>When he tells us of <hi>deſtroying him with our meat</hi> for <hi>whom Chriſt died,</hi> that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66530:47"/> (to return him ſome of thoſe <hi>Givilities</hi> which he beſtows on his <hi>Meiſner</hi>) is but one of his repeated fooleries; for it can concern no man but a <hi>Jew,</hi> or a <hi>Jews fellow</hi> (in whoſe account ſome meats and drinks are ſtill common and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean;) and this <hi>Reconciler</hi> does ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge (p. 74, 75.) that now the Apoſtles inſtructions of forbearance are out of date as to them, their ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs having cut them off from all <hi>Title</hi> to our <hi>Charity</hi> in that kind.

(Conte ad Rom.</hi> 14. And therefore when we eat with them we ſee they are in no more danger to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by our liberty than (we are upon the account of their forbearance.)

            <p>Here we obſerve a ſecond part to the ſame Tune; judging and deſpiſing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom God hath received; (which we ſhall conſider more fully preſently) walking uncharitably, deſtroying him with our meat for whom Chriſt died; as if he ſet himſelf up to be an <hi>Advocate</hi> for a Sect of <hi>Superſtitious Jews,</hi> who both killed the <hi>Lord</hi> their <hi>King</hi> (of whom they have been both the <hi>betrayers</hi> and <hi>Murderers</hi>) and their own <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and have perſecuted and chaſed out us; and they pleaſe not God, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all men, (1 Theſ.</hi> 2. 15.) For his ſtumbling-blocks (which he is ever laying in our way) and his charitably walking and his things that make for peace, we ſhall fully conſider them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we part.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>interim,</hi> we ſhall grant him, that this as well as other Scriptures <hi>being written for our Leraning,</hi> in caſes of like nature (if any ſuch can happen) muſt oblige all other <hi>Paſtors</hi> and Rulers of Chriſts Church, as well I will add, yea and as much) as thoſe at <hi>Rome</hi> (if there had been any ſuch when S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle.)</p>
            <p>But if all Scriptures be written for our Learning, in caſes of like nature;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66530:50"/> why do you not practiſe them equally all alike? We have thoſe two <hi>Tribes</hi> building their <hi>Altar,</hi> a <hi>ſymbolical</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of their Faith and Affiance in God of their Communion with his Church, and their Intereſt in his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip and Service; you have alſo in theſe Scriptures, the report of <hi>Daniels</hi> opening his Windows upon the ſame account, and to the very ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and we find <hi>Lyſerus, Lavator, Calvin,</hi> our <hi>Synopſis</hi> (and who not, that have conſidered the thing among our Proteſtant Divines) do make the ſign of the Croſs (in uſe among all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) a <hi>Parallel Caſe</hi> with thoſe, a <hi>ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical</hi> proteſtation of our Chriſtianity, of our Faith and Affiance in Chriſt Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, of Communion with Gods Holy Catholick Church, and of our Intereſt in all the priviledges of his publick Worſhip and Service: and this <hi>Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Proteſtation, is grounded upon the fundamental Article of Confeſſion, which is of moral and perpetual obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; why then is not this <hi>Reconciler</hi> as zealous a Champion for the uſe of that ancient Ceremony, as he is for matters of <hi>meat and drink,</hi> as he finds them in this preſent Scripture?</p>
            <pb n="97" facs="tcp:66530:50"/>
            <p>But I muſt obſerve (2.) That the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inference the Apoſtle makes from thoſe words, <hi>All Scripture is written for our Learning</hi> (which have relation to Chriſts Condeſcenſion to redeem and ſave us) <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 3, 4. is this (<hi>ver. 7.) wherefore receive ye one another, as Chriſt alſo received us, to the Glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This (ſaith <hi>Hemmingius</hi>) is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral concluſion of all the matters or concernments, which the Apoſtle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of from the beginning of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter. And that we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand our own, and take ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our Governors Duty (as far as modeſty and ſcripture will allow us,) Let us ſeriouſly Conſider</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Chriſt, tho he dyed for all men, yet he received none into actual Communion with him, but ſuch as were willing to be received.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He received none, but upon terms of his own and not of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He received none but upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of obedience to his Laws, and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions; whereof <hi>Government</hi> in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> is undoubtedly one.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:66530:51"/>4. He received none but to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God. Now to all ſuch the Arms of our Governors are opened, and they are moſt ready to receive them. But ſuch as muſt make their own Conditions, and come in only upon their own Terms, and thoſe terms of Diviſion, Chriſt never received ſuch, and we know the <hi>Jews</hi> were cut off upon that account: and therefore the Church cannot receive them to the glory of God, unleſs She ſhould acknowledge him to be a God of Confuſion and not of Peace and Order; To this purpoſe <hi>Eraſmus</hi> paraphraſeth the Text. <q>(<hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 7.)

            <p>This <hi>Reconciler,</hi> by the <hi>Scriptures written for our Learning</hi> underſtands the <hi>14th.</hi> and <hi>15th.</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which he makes the ſubject of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe (pag. 67.) tho he takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſeveral remarques, which the <hi>Verdict</hi> has thereon, and he ſhould have done well to have taught the people, what bitter animoſities, and ſad confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions did ariſe amongſt them, for want of good Laws, and Rules to direct the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and of <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:66530:51"/> and <hi>Governors</hi> to awe them into a due obedience.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Convert-Jews</hi> would by all means obſerve <hi>Moſes</hi> his Laws, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, even ſuch as were purely <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial;</hi> and not content with an allowance to do it themſelves, they would impoſe the practice upon all others; and becauſe the <hi>Gentiles</hi> would not obſerve them, tho reconciled to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> they would not admit them to their <hi>Communion.</hi> On the other ſide the <hi>Gentil-Converts,</hi> being very well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of the <hi>Liberty,</hi> which they had in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereby they were exempted from the Yoak of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, (which was never deſigned to be put upon the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians neck</hi>) they were no leſs earneſt to exclude from their <hi>Communion</hi> ſuch <hi>Jews</hi> as ſtill addicted themſelves to the Cuſtoms and Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Hereupon aroſe a wretched <hi>Schiſm</hi> which wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſtructed the progreſs of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi> amongſt them in the very infancy of it. And wanting <hi>Church-Governors,</hi> with a ſecular Arm to aſſiſt them, nothing was able to extinguiſh their diſſentions and bring them to a quiet ſettlement, till the fulneſs of <hi>Apoſtolical Authority</hi> with the power of <hi>Miracles</hi> ſhould come
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:66530:52"/> among them, as ſhall be declared here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>But, our <hi>Reconciler</hi> tells us, 'tis the perpetual Duty of the higheſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to <hi>follow after the things which make for Peace, and whereby they may edify one another.</hi> This we can eaſily grant him: but as <hi>Theodoret</hi> obſerves, the Apoſtle<note place="margin">Ad Rom. 15. 4.</note> does not pray for their peace indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and abſolutely, but 'tis an honeſt and pious Conſent and Concord that he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, according to the example of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> Has not God given us <hi>Guides,</hi> and are not we bound to follow peace after their direction and example? Have not they a command as well as a power<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 7, 17.</note> to ſet things in Order? to make Decrees and Ordinances for the eſtabliſhment of Peace and Unity? and are not theſe the means to promote Edification? Did not S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf carry about ſuch Decrees to be kept of the Churches where he went? and were not thoſe Churches eſtabliſhed in the Faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and increaſed in their numbers as well as in their piety by that means? <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Theſe are truths that are evident of themſelves, and owned by the Learned of all Perſwaſions, the Ordering and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66530:52"/> of honeſt and decent <hi>Rites,</hi>

            <p>Hereupon we find that the great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle made Ordinances of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which are called Traditions) and they were about things indifferent, of no abſolute <hi>neceſſity,</hi> but only for <hi>decency,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Womans Vail</hi> in <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>

And let this <hi>Reconciler</hi> or any of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> (whoſe Cauſe he Pleads) prove that ever the liberty of ſuch Children was allowed either by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, to overtop or check the Authority of ſuch a Father, and I will yield the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>In the mean while Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> keeps his Ground; <hi>viz.</hi> That this was only a <hi>Temporary</hi> proviſion to keep the Peace
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:66530:53"/> among private Chriſtians: and hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Reconciler</hi> requires him to prove that the things above-mentioned (<hi>Rom.</hi> 14.) were only <hi>Temporary;</hi> and that <hi>Church-Governors</hi> are now at liberty to walk uncharitably towards the weak, and to deſtroy the work of God for meat and drink, and we are ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Here we are called upon to prove two things; and I am afraid the laſt will prove him to be a <hi>Sophiſter.</hi> But we ſhall attempt to prove the firſt: That thoſe things were only Temporary.</p>
            <p>'Tis the expreſs affirmation of <hi>Aretius,</hi>

But my task is to prove that the Directions which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gives to thoſe Chriſtians at <hi>Rome,</hi> had a peculiar reference, (1.) To that preſent time. (2.) To ſome ſpecial things, and (3.) To that Critical Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>(1.) To that preſent time; and he that will take the pains to conſider the Caſe, can never be perſwaded, that ſuch cautions and directions as were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Gentil-Converts,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence purely to thoſe <hi>Federal Rites</hi> of the reſpective Inſtitutions, to which they had ſo lately been accuſtomed; He I ſay, can never be convinced, that they do lay any obligation upon ſuch as were bred up in <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> from their Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles. But that theſe cautions were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for that preſent time, we have reaſon to believe upon farther evidence.</p>
            <p>1. The Apoſtle in his great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was wont to make ſuch Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 26.</note>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:66530:54"/> proviſions; ſuch was his advice about Virgins; <hi>I ſuppoſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>this is good for the preſent diſtreſs:</hi> not that Marriage was a more impure ſtate of Life: but to avoid the difficulties and moleſtations of it. Single perſons were in a better condition, more prompt and eaſie to grapple with Perſecutions, which in thoſe days did more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflict the Profeſſors of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle has an eye to the like<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 11.</note> difficulties among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he enjoyns them to be <hi>fervent in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſerving the ſeaſon;</hi> For many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> his note on the place, and Dr. <hi>Stearne Aphoriſ. de fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitate, §. 2.

               </note> read the Text ſo, and therefore Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> doth thus Paraphraſe the Text: Doing thoſe things, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Circumſtances of time and place, wherein now you are, may moſt tend to the honour of God, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Church.

And S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf made it his practice, ſometimes to apply himſelf to the ſeaſon, and to do that which otherwiſe he had no inclination to do. For he Circumciſed <hi>Timothy</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly; and ſhaving his head he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified himſelf according to the Law, and went up to the Temple, <hi>

            <p>2.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:66530:56"/> to little purpoſe, in this caſe rightly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For</p>
            <p>4. I dare be bold to ſay, that not one of the Ancient Fathers ever applied that diſcourſe of the Apoſtle to the prejudice of Authority in ordaining Rites and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Decency in Gods Service. Did not all the Fathers he alledges, <hi>Bow, Kneel, wear a Surplice, ſign with the Croſs?</hi> Yes, and would have ſpit in his face, that ſhould have offered to diſpute ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral a practice of the whole Church. His quoting their Authority in this caſe is therefore trifling, and deſigned to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the Reader, or elſe he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded himſelf by a <hi>Fanatic Zeal,</hi> and <hi>vain Imagination;</hi> And if old Father <hi>Gregory</hi> were alive he would make as ſharp an <hi>Invective</hi> againſt him for this, as he did againſt <hi>Julian</hi> upon another account.</p>
            <p>And I have obſerved particularly<note place="margin">Vide Epiſt. 119</note> that St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> when he complains of the multitude and burden of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which were crept into ſome particular Churches, yet he never dream'd that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had condemned any of them by a Spirit of Propheſie in that Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans:</hi> Nay he ſaith plainly, that the forbidding of meats as unclean,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66530:57"/> was Heretical, and ſo declared and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Apoſtle. (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.) which is directly contrary to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and practice of thoſe weak ones, whom the ſame Apoſtle favours (<hi>Rom.</hi> 14.) and therefore the Rules he lays down in that Chapter, can be no more than <hi>temporary,</hi> unleſs we will be ſo bold with the great Apoſtle as to make him forget and contradict himſelf.</p>
            <p>(4.) Let me put the Caſe home to our <hi>Reconciler</hi> and his beloved, the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters;</hi> if they claim a title to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Indulgence (<hi>Rom.</hi> 14.) in their refuſal, or forbearance of thoſe things which are enjoyned by <hi>Authority;</hi> Then they muſt look upon thoſe things as common and unclean; for that is the very caſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks to, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 14.) If they eſteem them unclean (which ſignifies nothing but unlawful) that muſt be either according to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Law,</hi> or according to the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> If they go according to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, they run into <hi>Judaiſm</hi> and <hi>Superſtition;</hi> and tempt God, as this <hi>Reconciler</hi> confeſſeth (p. 75.) and in effect, deny that <hi>Judaiſm</hi> is aboliſhed, and hath given place to <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> if they pretend to go by the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that very <hi>Goſpel</hi> contradicts their pretence, as we
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66530:57"/> learn by a voice from Heaven to S. <hi>Peter, Acts 10. 15. What God hath cleanſed, that call not thou common</hi> (for perſons were ſo eſteemed by the Law as well as things) and by the reſolution of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in this place, <hi>Rom. 14. 14. I know and am perſwaded by the Lord Jeſus, that there is nothing unclean of it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(5.) And I would have it conſidered, that we have no Rites or Obſervances in uſe among us, but what are taken up by the light of <hi>Nature,</hi> or purely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> They never had any Relation to the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> as the meats offered to Idols, nor yet to the <hi>Levitical Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> as Swines-fleſh, Circumciſion, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sacrifices, and Feſtivals had. Shew me where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, one man regardeth a <hi>Surplice,</hi> the <hi>ſign</hi> of the <hi>Croſs, kneeling;</hi> another man regardeth them not: Do not Judge, do not grieve, do not offend a Brother for theſe things. He did not, he could not ſay any thing to this effect, of any of theſe<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 26, Eph. 3. 14.</note> things; not of <hi>kneeling</hi> or <hi>bowing;</hi> for they are ſuggeſted to all mankind by the light of <hi>Nature,</hi> and were the Apoſtles<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 5, 11.</note> own intimation, charge, and practice. The <hi>Surplice</hi> he determined in the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66530:58"/> Vaile</hi> by a <hi>Parity</hi> of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and for the ſign of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> 'tis ſo pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly related to Chriſtianity, that it can never tempt any man to turn either <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile</hi> (which was the great danger St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo carefully provides againſt) and he hath given us a Reaſon for it;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 22.</note> in telling us, that <hi>Chriſt Crucified was unto the Jews a ſtumbling-block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs.</hi> To this I may add</p>
            <p>(6.) The general opinion of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators is, that the Apoſtle does not<note place="margin">Anon. ad Rom. 14. not. 1.</note> ſpeak here (<hi>Rom.</hi> 14.) of the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of a <hi>Brother</hi> in doing any thing unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; or that he ſhould be tolerated by the <hi>ſtrong</hi> therein.</p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>let every man</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 5.</note> 
               <hi>abound in his own ſenſe,</hi> (according to the <hi>vulgar Latin) or let him be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded</hi>
               <note place="margin">Theod. ad Rom. 14. 5.</note> 
               <hi>in his own mind,</hi> (as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hath it,) <hi>Theodoret</hi> obſerves, that the Apoſtle did not ſpeak this in general, nor may we be ſo free in our opinions or perſwaſions of Gods Word and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, for he doth anathematize or<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 8, 9.</note> ſtrike him with a Curſe, who frames his mind to teach the things that are contrary to Divine Truth. And <hi>Gualter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gualter. ad Roman. Homil. 80.</note> to the ſame ſenſe, <hi>Quae palam contra Dei voluntatem fiunt, ea in proximo reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:66530:58"/> deque illis ex Dei verbo judicare licet:</hi> What is clearly contrary to the will of God, 'tis Lawful for a man to judge of that by the word of God, and to reprehend our Neighbour for it. Now certainly this is Gods Ordinance, <hi>let every Soul be ſubject to the higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> and this is the will of God, even our <hi>Submiſſion</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to ſuch as<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1. Heb. 13. 7, 17.</note> God hath <hi>ſet over us.</hi> Wherefore unleſs the Apoſtle contradicts his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he cannot be ſuppoſed to deliver any thing in this caſe that may derogate from the juſt power of our Superiors: And let it be once proved, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle has ſet up <hi>Liberty</hi> above <hi>Authority,</hi> or in oppoſition to it, and I ſhall yield the Cauſe: but this is a <hi>challenge,</hi> which I dare ſay none of our <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> No, nor the <hi>Reconciler</hi> himſelf, will have the hardineſs to anſwer.</p>
            <p>3. I ſay, Thoſe Directions of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> had a ſpecial reference to that <hi>Critical Diſpenſation.</hi> I call it <hi>Critical;</hi> becauſe it was ſomething like that jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of circumſtances, which hapned in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Voyage to <hi>Rome;</hi> when they came to the place where two Seas met; <hi>except</hi> the <hi>Mariners</hi> (the Guides of the Veſſel) <hi>did abide in the Ship,</hi> and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:66530:59"/> ſubmit to the Apoſtles prudent Steer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and Direction, <hi>They could not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For that this Indulgence of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was in favour of the <hi>Jews,</hi> cannot be denied; and he had taken the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Colledge of Apoſtles and Elders in it, who tell him thus, <hi>Acts 21. 20. Thou ſeeſt Brother, how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Jews there are which believe, and they are all zealous of the Law.</hi> Now<note place="margin">Exodus 19.</note> the condition of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was this, The Religion eſtabliſhed amongſt them was of Divine Inſtitution, and the Rites and Ceremonies thereof impoſed with great ſeverity, by a dreadful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with an aſtoniſhing attendance; this they had been bred in and lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and were prepoſſeſſed with an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Sacredneſs and perpetual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of it. But out of this ſprang a more refined Religion, introduced by the Miniſtry of the Son of God.</p>
            <p>Whether the introduction of this did abrogate or ſuperſede the Authority of the other, was the thing in queſtion. The prejudice the <hi>Jews</hi> had againſt the abrogation of it (for the Reaſons now mentioned) was ſo great, that it was not eaſie to be conquered. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:66530:59"/> was ſenſible hereof, (for he loſt his own <hi>Carnal</hi> eyes before he could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern<note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> a Reaſon for it) and <hi>he was ſmitten down to the Earth,</hi> that he might there bury thoſe beggarly Elements of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm</hi> (wherein he had been Diſciplined and for which he was ſo fiercely <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>) before he could learn humility enough to ſubmit to the Voice and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and this made him ſo compaſſionate to his <hi>Brethren</hi> of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> whom he knew to lye under the like prepoſſeſſion and prejudice.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Law</hi> was out of date, <hi>de jure,</hi> upon the publication of<note place="margin">John 1. 31. Heb. 10. 1.</note> the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and aſſoon as our Lord was made manifeſt unto <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For <hi>the Law was but a ſhadow of good things to come: the Body</hi> and the Sun <hi>was Chriſt,</hi> the<note place="margin">Col. 2. 17. Rom. 10. 4.</note> end and the Accompliſher of the Law. <hi>De Jure</hi> therefore, the Law of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies was aboliſh'd: But yet till there was a clear promulgation hereof, the old Law retained its force and vigour among ſuch as underſtood not that it was now void and of no effect. For tho the Law ceaſes by a meer abrogation, yet the Subject cannot be free from his former obligation, till it does ſome way appear, that 'tis his Superiors will and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:66530:60"/> that the former Law be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently revoked; which was not yet made manifeſt <hi>convincingly</hi> to all the <hi>Community</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that which increaſed the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and confirmed, if not heightned the prejudices on both ſides was this: The <hi>Jews,</hi> they received the gifts of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act. 2. Act.</hi> 10, 44, 45. and Chap. 11. 2. to 18.</note> Ghoſt under the obſervation of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s <hi>Law;</hi> the <hi>Gentils</hi> did the like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the omiſſion and neglect of it. Hereupon, why ſhould we abandon our old Law, ſeeing God hath received us<note place="margin">All this the <hi>Reconciler</hi> does acknowledge page. 74.</note> into favour, and atteſted it by the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his Spirit on us, ſay the <hi>Jews?</hi> And why ſhall we abandon our <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Privilege,</hi> ſay thoſe <hi>Gentils,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God hath done the like to us? This was the difference and diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; and nothing but the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry</hi> of a <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> aſſiſted by the extraordinary gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (and agreeing in a Declaration to the ſame effect) and the power of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> was able to bring them to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and unite them entirely into one <hi>Catholick Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I call a <hi>Critical diſpenſation;</hi> and it can never be the Caſe of the Chriſtian Church again, unleſs <hi>Elias</hi> ſhould come a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:66530:60"/> ſecond time (as ſome do vainly dream) to make a farther Reformation; and then perhaps, S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Rules might be in ſeaſon again, before the World could come to any ſettlement.</p>
            <p>How far is the Caſe of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> wide of this? were they bred under any other <hi>Divine Law</hi> than that which we profeſs and practiſe? Have they any pretence to ſome other divine Inſtitutions? Have they any divine prohibition againſt any thing the Church obſerves? Do we vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late any Ordinance that is known to be prae-eſtabliſht by <hi>Divine Authority?</hi> why then do they take up the perverſe or peeviſh practice of thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> and run upon the ſame <hi>Rock</hi> of <hi>Judaiſm</hi> and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> as if they were called to it by a voice from Heaven, when they have not the like pretence for it? For either the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is in force, or it is not: If they think it is in force, They may ſcruple at the eating of a black Pudding or touching the Corps of their deareſt friend deceaſed, or plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with an Oxe and an Aſſe (which conjunction, in a Tropical ſenſe, they never ſcruple at): If that Law be not in force at all, in their opinion, why do they plead, what S. <hi>Paul</hi> diſcourſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:66530:61"/> the account of them who believed it was? If it concerns us at all, it muſt be either directly, or indirectly and by a parity of Reaſon. But (1.) not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly; becauſe it relates to a Law, whereby things were diſtinguiſh'd into clean and unclean. (2.) Not indirectly or by a parity of Reaſon; becauſe the like <hi>critical</hi> juncture of <hi>circumſtances</hi> is never like to happen.</p>
            <p>Let them therefore ſet their hearts at reſt. For thoſe Rules of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention and forbearance which the Apoſtle preſcribed as a <hi>temporary</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to keep thoſe private Chriſtians quiet, under that <hi>Critical Diſpenſation,</hi> can never ſerve to juſtifie their <hi>Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> upon ſuch groundleſs doubts, empty Scruples, and vain Imaginations.</p>
            <p>And now having made it clear to all<note place="margin">Rom. 14. &amp; 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Chapters.</note> impartial Readers, that the Apoſtle did not direct this his advice to <hi>Governors:</hi> but preſcribed it only as a <hi>Temporary</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion to keep the peace among private Chriſtians: We muſt expect no Quarter from the <hi>Reconciler,</hi> but to be ſeverely loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with the reproach of an odious Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. 'Tis not enough it ſeems to prove that the things there mentioned were only <hi>Temporary,</hi> but we are called to a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:66530:61"/> freſh Task, to prove that <hi>Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors are now at liberty to walk uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly towards the weak, and to deſtroy the work of God for meat and drink:</hi> Do this ſays he, very fairly, and we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
            <p>This any man would think a fair offer at the firſt hearing: but upon ſecond thoughts, we find that by ſuppreſſing one of the premiſſes he hides a ſallacy: and herein he is either catch'd himſelf, and deceived in his own captious way of reaſoning, and that betrays his want of Logick: or elſe he deſigns wittingly to impoſe upon the weakneſs or credulity of his Reader; and then he ſhews his want of honeſty.</p>
            <p>If we put his Argument into Form for him, it muſt run thus: He that ſays, Thoſe Rules above-mentioned were but a <hi>Temporary Proviſion</hi> to keep the Peace among private Chriſtians, he leaves <hi>Church-Governors</hi> at liberty to walk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably towards the weak, and to deſtroy the work of God for meat and drink.</p>
            <p>But Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> ſays, Thoſe Rules above-mentioned, were but a <hi>Temporary Proviſion</hi> to keep the Peace among pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtians, <hi>ergo</hi> Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> leaves <hi>Church-Governors</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:66530:62"/>
            <p>We muſt give him time to prove the major Propoſition; and I believe he will take till <hi>Dooms-day,</hi> and then he may have ſomething elſe to anſwer for; His diſturbing the peace of the Church, and encouraging an ungovernable <hi>Faction</hi> in their <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Sedition.</hi> But let us follow him.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> ſaith from <hi>Catharinus,</hi> They were Rules to be received till the Apoſtles had made a perfect determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <q>and truly ſaith the <hi>Reconciler,</hi> if this were all, they were not to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at all. His Reaſon follows; For in this very Chapter he plainly ſaith, that the things ſcrupled by the weak were pure and lawful in themſelves; and that he knew, and was perſwaded by the Lord Jeſus, that there was nothing unclean of it ſelf; which is as perfect, and full a determination of the Caſe, againſt the weak, as words can make.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let us take notice (1.) that we have here the Key put into our hands, by the Apoſtle himſelf, to open and unlock his meaning, and to give us the full account of his deſign; which was to indulge the <hi>Jewiſh Chriſtians,</hi> who had been bred up under the <hi>Moſaical Diſpenſation;</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:66530:62"/> wherein days and meats were diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed into ſuch as were clean or unclean, common or holy; which cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us who pretend to no ſuch diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in that Legal ſenſe or of any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority. Having obſerved thus much,</p>
            <p>(2.) I anſwer. That the Apoſtle did declare his judgment in the Caſe, as to the matters in queſtion <hi>de jure:</hi> but as to the uſe and practice of them at <hi>Rome,</hi> He did not as yet ſettle or determine them <hi>de facto,</hi> by his Apoſtolical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But with us the caſe is otherwiſe; we have a Determination and Settlement againſt our pretended weak ones, both <hi>de jure</hi> and <hi>de facto</hi> too.</p>
            <p>For they know there is nothing <hi>de jure</hi> unclean, or unlawful among us, and that <hi>de Facto,</hi> Authority hath ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led what they diſpute againſt.</p>
            <p>That S. <hi>Paul</hi> has determined the Caſe <hi>de jure,</hi> we have his own conceſſion; and that (elſewhere) he did ſtate and ſettle it, <hi>de facto,</hi> he is forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs; and indeed his conceſſions are ſo full, when he comes to himſelf, that they are a perfect confutation of his whole Book, if a man would give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:66530:63"/> the trouble or the leiſure to collect them.</p>
            <p>That the Apoſtle did determine the Caſe <hi>de facto</hi> as to other Churches, are ſo full and clear, that we have no need of other evidence to prove it: <q>The<note place="margin">Theſe Epiſtles were written after that to the <hi>Romans.</hi>

            <p>But for the preſent, as the <hi>Gentile Converts</hi> had great aſſurance of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity from the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo thoſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> were under great prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces through their veneration for it: And the <hi>Impoſtors</hi> and falſe <hi>Teachers,</hi> (headed perhaps by <hi>Simon Magus</hi> who<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Ham.</hi> Annotat. on the Title of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> towards the end.</note> had the reputation of a <hi>God</hi> among the <hi>Romans</hi>) were ſo ſubtile and powerful with the Heathen Magiſtrate, that a peremptory order from the Apoſtle, (if ſuch a one had been ſent,) eſpecially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no <hi>Governor</hi> to enforce it, in all probability, could have taken no effect.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:66530:64"/> The Apoſtle therefore defers this great work (as he did the ſetling of ſome ſuch matters in other Churches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. laſt.) till his own coming with the fulneſs of <hi>Apoſtolical Power</hi> and the <hi>gift of Miracles,</hi> to encounter all the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>In the mean while having felt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuch an experiment of mercy, for the things which he had done in his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and unbelief, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13.)

            <p>There was little hopes therefore that the order of a Perſon at a diſtance, who had never been amongſt them ſhould be of any force to quell ſuch Heads of the Faction or to remove their prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo as to unite them in the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and practice, aso t theſe matters; But the Apoſtle foretold and promiſed that this ſhould be done ſhortly; and how was that?</p>
            <p>Shortly, <hi>Hoc de adventu ſuo dicit;</hi>

            <p>And this the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> might very well promiſe without boaſting, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that power, which Chriſt did beſtow upon his Apoſtles, a <hi>power to tread upon Serpents, and Scorpions and all</hi> the power of the Enemy (<hi>Luke</hi> 10.)

            <p>And this he might very well be ſure of, upon a double account; that is, both by experience, and by Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. (1.) His experience might well aſſure him hereof; For he was thus highly furniſh'd in his adminiſtrations to other Churches: Thus he tells the <hi>Corinthians: Truly the ſigns of an Apoſtle</hi>

               <hi>were wrought among you in all patience in ſigns, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</hi> And thus he expoſtulates with the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians:

            <p>And (2.) we may very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude<note place="margin">Acts 19. 21.</note> too, that he had this aſſurance by <hi>Revelation;</hi> for the Text ſays expreſly. <hi>That he purpoſed by the Spirit to go to viſit</hi>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66530:67"/> the Apoſtle was ſure, that the Church at <hi>Rome</hi> would be ſhortly reſcued from thoſe peſtilent Impoſtors and Diſſentions, which the event witneſſed accordingly. <hi>Haymo</hi> is moſt full in it: I'll tranſcribe his words. <hi>Spiritu prophetico afflatus, talia cum ſecuritate dicebat. Quum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem dicit, in abundantiâ benedictionis Chriſti veniam, tale eſt, quale &amp; illud quod in exordio hujus Epiſtolae dixit, Deſidero, (inquiens) venire ad vos, ut aliquid gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae Spiritalis impertiar vobis, ad confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandos vos. In abundantiâ benedictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis veniam plenitudine virtutum, ut meâ praedicatione quod minus habetis in fide, percipiatis ex virtute miraculorum, quae apud vos operabor, roboremini in eadem fide, ut majorem gratiam Chriſti in meo adventu percipere mereamini. Sic etenim fecit, quia veniens, quod illis deerat in fide, in charitate, &amp; in caeteris rebus ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talibus, ſuo adventu ſupplevit. Haymo</hi> above eight hundred years ago, does deliver this ſenſe fully upon the Text, <q>(<hi>Rom. 15.) Being inſpired by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Spirit, he delivered theſe things with great confidence.</hi> When he ſaith I ſhall come in the abundance of the bleſſing of Chriſt. He repeats what he had ſaid in the beginning of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:66530:67"/> his Epiſtle (chap. 1. 11.) for I long to ſee you, that I may impart unto you ſome ſpiritual gift, to the end you may be eſtabliſhed. I will come unto you in the abundance of the benediction of the Goſpel, that is, in the fulneſs of power and virtue, that what you have wanting in the Faith, by my Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you may receive it by the power of Miracles, which I will work among you, that ye may be confirmed in that Faith; that you may receive a greater meaſure of the grace of Chriſt at my coming. And this the Apoſtle did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; for what was wanting in their Faith, in their Charity, and in other Spiritual Graces, He ſupplied it at his coming to them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſhort is, the Apoſtle does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his ſenſe concerning thoſe <hi>Ritual obſervances:</hi> but he ſent no peremptory command, that they ſhould preſently walk up to the truth and priviledge of the Goſpel in the practice or forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe things.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe there was no <hi>Biſhop</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor</hi> ſetled to enforce the obſervation of ſuch a command, if it had been ſent. And (2.) Becauſe the oppoſition was ſo ſtiff, and the oppoſers ſo ſubtil and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:66530:68"/> that there was no likelihood that an order or command ſent at a great diſtance from a perſon whom they had never ſeen, ſhould take effect amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Therefore he reſerved the full deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination &amp; ſettlement of this difference<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 1, 2, 3.</note> till his coming to them in the fulneſs of the <hi>Apoſtolical Authority,</hi> and the power of <hi>Miracles,</hi> which he made uſe of in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of other Churches. In the mean while the moſt prudent proviſion he could make was (1.) To adviſe them to a<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 17.</note> fair compliance with all Chriſtian meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and condeſcention; and to forbear contempt and raſh judgment; And (2.) To avoid the peſtilent Infuſions of Impoſtors, by withdrawing from them. This juſtifies the ſentiment of <hi>Grotius</hi> and the <hi>Verdict.</hi>

            <p>The next place I find Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> concerned in, is at pag. 77. where the<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Reconciler</hi> obſerves, <q>That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here declares, that the eating of thoſe things, which the weak Brother durſt not eat, was a thing Lawful in it ſelf, and that he was perſwaded thus to judge by the Lord Jeſus, and ſo the ſcandal which the weak Chriſtian took at the freedom of the ſtrong, who uſed his Chriſtian Liberty in eating of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66530:68"/> theſe things, was <hi>ſcandalum acceptum non datum,</hi> ſcandal <hi>Received</hi> but not <hi>Given,</hi> the action being ſuch as the weak Chriſtian could not juſtly be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at: And yet the Apoſtle plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth condemn both here and in the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> verſe 8. the miniſtring occaſion to this ſcandal. And therefore tho this Scandal which the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> take at things indifferent enjoyned by Superiors, be ſcandal received and not given, this doth not hinder but it may be the Duty of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors not to afford occaſion to it, by the impoſing of theſe things, &amp;c.</q>

But of this we ſhall have a more fit occaſion to diſcourſe anon.</p>
            <p>At preſent, we are to obſerve, That tho the Apoſtle did declare, that the things which the ſtrong did eat, and the weak were offended at were lawful in themſelves <hi>de jure;</hi> and that he was ſo perſwaded by the Lord Jeſus; yet he did not, <hi>de facto,</hi> preſently determine

The ſenſe of the Apoſtle (as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſums up in his <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13.) amounts to this, That the Apoſtle to prevent ſin, (and eſpecially the ſin of Apoſtacy) in others, was willing to deny himſelf that Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which by the Law of Chriſt did truly belong to him: and every good Chriſtian will be ready to do the ſame, where there is a juſt occaſion for it. But we muſt remember that our Liberty tho an excellent Privilege, yet is not ſuch an abſolute good thing, but it may be abuſed and evil ſpoken of; and 'tis<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 16.</note> as juſtly evil ſpoken of, when it is abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Sedition,</hi> as when 'tis abuſed to gratifie our <hi>fleſhly Luſts,</hi> and turned into <hi>wantonneſs.</hi> But I am ſure no good man, no wiſe man, will ſpeak evil of my <hi>Liberty,</hi> when 'tis governed by a juſt <hi>Authority.</hi> For I am not bound<note place="margin">Ameſius ubi ſupra.</note> to diſobey the juſt <hi>Impoſitions</hi> of my <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, i. e.</hi> I am not bound to omit my neceſſary Duty, or to commit a ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am not bound to go to <hi>Hell</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void <hi>Scandal: Charity</hi> begins at home, and there it obliges me to avoid ſin in my ſelf, before I prevent it in another. The Truth is, the <hi>Reconciler</hi> is inſnared in a <hi>Fallacy,</hi> and out of great kindneſs
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:66530:77"/> he would draw in his <hi>Brethren</hi> for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. The Fallacy is <hi>à dicto ſecundùm quid:</hi> and tho it be not ſo perceivable in this, yet in the other inſtance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5, 6. it would appear too groſs to be ſwallowed; for thus it would run: <hi>It is not good to regard a day unto the Lord, whereby my brother ſtumbleth, or is offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or is made weak.</hi> Rom. 14. 21. <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a day make my Brother to offend, I will never regard a day, never perform any ſolemn worſhip to God, leſt I make my brother to offend.</hi> In this <hi>parallel</hi> inſtance he muſt diſtinguiſh of the Apoſtles meaning, or confeſs his own falſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Reconciler,</hi> whilſt he allows nothing to be <hi>Lawful,</hi> but what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and commanded, he deſtroys <hi>Authority,</hi> he deſtroys <hi>Liberty,</hi> and (in contradiction to his own <hi>Hypotheſis</hi>) he impoſes (a <hi>Duty</hi> I cannot call it but) a <hi>Task</hi> which is <hi>impoſſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1.) He deſtroys <hi>Authority;</hi> he ſets up the fourteenth againſt the thirteenth to the <hi>Romans:</hi> And the command of <hi>Subjection</hi> to the higher powers he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouls by that expoſtulation: <hi>Who are thou that judgeſt another mans Servant.</hi> In favour of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> weakneſs, he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66530:78"/> brings a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> againſt the force of <hi>Lawful Impoſitions;</hi> and to ſecure them in their Superſtition, he makes a <hi>Tender Conſcience</hi> a <hi>Superſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> to the Sacred <hi>Prerogative</hi> of <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of <hi>Governors;</hi> of which we ſhall deliver more hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>(2.) If he allows nothing to be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful but what is <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>commanded,</hi> he deſtroys <hi>Liberty.</hi> For what is that Liberty, <hi>wherewith Chriſt hath made us free?</hi> (not to ſpeak of our freedom from ſin and Satan) was it not from the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes?</hi> If we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Law, then from the diſtinction of things <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean,</hi> from things that were not accounted ſuch; if from that <hi>diſtinction,</hi> then from the <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> Opinions and ſcruples of men about things <hi>indifferent,</hi> which are grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>diſtinction.</hi> But if we be not ſet at <hi>Liberty</hi> from mens <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> Opinions and Scruples about things <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi> then are we ſtill under that <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction</hi> of things <hi>Common and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean,</hi> and that <hi>diſtinction</hi> brings us directly under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Yoak of Bondage: And if ſo, we are in a much worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:66530:78"/> than the <hi>Jews</hi> were, our burden and thraldom greater; for that which obliged them was only the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of God; but we are inthral'd to the <hi>Caprichioes</hi> of men; and not to the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> or <hi>ſqueamiſh Fancy</hi> of any ſingle Perſon, but of a <hi>Multitude,</hi> who can pretend no <hi>Authority</hi> over us, but their own will and pleaſure, which is a <hi>deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the Goſpel, and a <hi>ſubjection</hi> of our <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> to the <hi>Arbitrary whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys</hi> of all weak and <hi>Fanatick</hi> Perſons.</p>
            <p>3. And this will deſtroy our peace too; For one man will think he may take up <hi>Arms</hi> againſt his <hi>Prince,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his <hi>conceits</hi> and <hi>ſcruples,</hi> which he calls his <hi>Religion;</hi> (for what has been done, may be done again, by men of the ſame <hi>Principles,</hi>) another will think he may not: one man will think he may <hi>diſobey</hi> his <hi>Church-Governors,</hi> another will think he may not: if no man may be allowed to judge in this caſe (as I do not ſee how they can, according to this <hi>Reconcilers</hi> ſenſe and principles,) what will be the end of our Peace, or what will become of ſuch <hi>Diſſentions?</hi> One man thinks he may wear a <hi>Surplice:</hi> why? becauſe Authority has enjoyned it: Another thinks he may not: why?
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:66530:79"/> he has no reaſon for it, but his own will and humour. If he ſaith, he refuſeth it, becauſe God has not commanded it; The other will reply, he does it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath not forbidden it: And herein he follows the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> own <hi>Rule, He obeys God rather than Man;</hi> For <hi>God</hi> commands him to obey <hi>thoſe that are ſet over him:</hi> but they tempt him to diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey our <hi>Guides</hi> and follow a <hi>Rabble,</hi> who have no ſtamp at all of <hi>Authority</hi> to recommend them to our obſervance.</p>
            <p>To go further; If this Doctrine of the <hi>Reconciler</hi> were in force, no man could be ſure that he is at peace with God, or his own Conſcience. For let the Apoſtle profeſs as he doth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12.</note> 12. <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our Conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the Grace of God, we have had our Converſation in the World, and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly to you-wards:</hi> The <hi>weak Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> can tell him, his glorying is not good, for he hath walked <hi>uncharitably,</hi> he has done ſuch things as were <hi>unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> and <hi>uncommanded,</hi> whereby he <hi>ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> and was <hi>offended,</hi> and <hi>grieved,</hi> and <hi>made weak:</hi> and that hereby he had <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the work of God,</hi> and a perſon
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:66530:79"/> 
               <hi>for whom Chriſt died,</hi> and made <hi>his good evil ſpoken of,</hi> and tho there were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any <hi>moral evil</hi> in the <hi>nature of the things</hi> he did, nor any <hi>evil intention</hi> in his doing of them, yet he had <hi>taken of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> and in the event he was actually ruined by his practice, <hi>as much as if he had deſigned it;</hi> and therefore he muſt expect to bear his Judgement for it. Can any man that underſtands his <hi>Intereſt</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> think himſelf concerned in ſuch <hi>Scruples,</hi> and <hi>Objections;</hi> or diſturb his <hi>inward</hi> peace upon that account?</p>
            <p>4. For this Doctrine, that I muſt do nothing that is <hi>unneceſſary</hi> and <hi>uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> for fear of <hi>Scandal,</hi> puts a man upon a task which is <hi>impoſſible;</hi> For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a <hi>Diſſenter</hi> ſees me (for example) wear a <hi>Surplice;</hi> he tells me he is <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> at it, he is <hi>grieved</hi> and <hi>ſtumbled,</hi> and <hi>made weak</hi> (which perhaps he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not the meaning of) to give him the better ſatisfaction I conſult the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler</hi> (as the great <hi>Oracle</hi> of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) in the caſe: he tells me I muſt <hi>forbear</hi> the uſe of it in hopes to gain this <hi>weak Brother,</hi> Well, I obey him and lay it by. But then a <hi>Conformiſt</hi> comes in and obſerves me to <hi>officiate</hi> without
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:66530:80"/> it; hereat he is offended, and tells me it <hi>grieves him</hi> to ſee <hi>Authority</hi> contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the <hi>Laws</hi> violated, <hi>Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> betrayed by the <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of a thing <hi>indifferent,</hi> to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie a <hi>Faction</hi> ſet up againſt the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> This he will ſay does <hi>weaken</hi> his faith, and makes him queſtion the <hi>ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of ſuch as <hi>profeſs</hi> the Goſpel, and the <hi>Religion</hi> eſtabliſhed among us. By this Inſtance, it is evident I cannot pleaſe them both; I muſt <hi>unavoidably</hi> offend one of them. Can I prevent them both from taking offence? This affair is attended with ſuch <hi>perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,</hi> that the performance is <hi>impoſſible;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caſ. Conſ. l. 5. c. 11. n. 18.</note> and therefore it cannot be a Chriſtian <hi>Duty.</hi> And for this I have the ſuffrage of <hi>Ameſius,</hi> tho, in his time, a <hi>ſtiff Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter: Nulla datur talis perplexitas, ut neceſſarium ſit pio homini, ſive hoc vel illud faciat, ſive non faciat, ſcandalum alicui dare:</hi> There can be no ſuch caſe of perplexity, that it ſhould be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a pious man to give any man <hi>ſcandal,</hi> whether he does this or that, or does it not. But how to avoid ſuch <hi>perplexity,</hi> we muſt find out ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rule, among the <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> than this <hi>Reconciler</hi> has yet preſcribed or found out for us.</p>
            <pb n="157" facs="tcp:66530:80"/>
            <p>To ſhew his Ingenuity towards Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> (or his artifice of concealment) I ſhall let the Reader ſee how this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">pag. 114.</note> was managed in the <hi>Verdict:</hi> 
               <q>where he takes notice from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, that one man <hi>will obſerve a day,</hi> another <hi>will not;</hi> one man will eat <hi>Swines-fleſh,</hi> another does abhor it. I<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 5.</note> cannot ſatisfie them both, for both are <hi>ſcrupulous,</hi> and both reſpectively <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended</hi> at one anothers practice. To <hi>eat</hi> and not to <hi>eat,</hi> to <hi>eſteem</hi> a day and not to <hi>eſteem</hi> it; theſe are perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions; and 'tis <hi>impoſſible</hi> for any Charity to reconcile mans practice to both their ſcruples. S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf (at laſt) found this ſo <hi>perplex'd</hi> a caſe that the difficulty was <hi>inſuperable:</hi> This he learnt by experience, upon the <hi>congreſs</hi> of the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile Converts</hi> at <hi>Antioch, Gal.</hi> 2. (of which we have given ſome account already) wherefore inſtead of a prudent, and charitable expedient (which in this caſe was impoſſible to find out) He <hi>withſtood</hi> S. <hi>Peter to the face,</hi> and with great Integrity and Stoutneſs, aſſerted the truth of the Goſpel and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty.</hi> And herein he left us his own practice for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:66530:81"/> to maintain our <hi>Privilege;</hi> and not to govern our ſelves by the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous <hi>ſqueamiſhneſs,</hi> or pretended <hi>ſcruples</hi> of <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> men, (which may be contradictory and endleſs) but by the ſolid <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> and the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Reſolutions</hi> of <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Careful Governors.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this with the words of <hi>Rollock:</hi>

                  <hi>ſelves in our actings, that we aim at Gods glory above all things, and do not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the limits of our Office and Calling, we may act confidently, tho all the World be offended at us, and after we have done what we ought and what we were able to do, if the ſucceſs does not anſwer our expectation ſo happily as we could wiſh,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>yet let us not be dejected at it; but enjoy that good Conſcience, which the Apoſtle glories in. (2 Cor.</hi> 1. 12.) <q>This will be of great force and efficacy to our comfort and rejoycing in the time of adverſity, and this we cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; if we keep within the bounds of our Profeſſion and Calling, and ſet the glory of God before our eyes in all our actions.</q> Thus ſaith <hi>R.

            <pb n="159" facs="tcp:66530:81"/>
            <p>But let us hear what he hath to ſay further againſt Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> which is as followeth: <q>
                  <hi>Secondly, whereas he adds, that the ſcandal here ſpoken of, is in a matter of our own choice, and power,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 79.</note> 
                  <hi>and it is to be underſtood in a matter wherein Authority hath not interpoſed her determination;</hi>
               </q> This (he grants) <hi>is very true, and the natural Inference from it is this, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the <hi>Reconciler fully</hi> acquits Dr. <hi>Womocks</hi> Doctrine in this point of <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal;</hi> who pleads only for thoſe things wherein <hi>Authority</hi> hath interpoſed her <hi>Determination.</hi> Why then is he ſo pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh and froward towards the Dr. when he ſeems to acquit? The reaſon is this, he would ſet up the <hi>Liberty of the Subject,</hi> in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> againſt <hi>the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Prince and Biſhop,</hi> which is eſtabliſh'd in the ſame <hi>Charter</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> by a divine <hi>Grant,</hi> precedent to that Liberty; and becauſe Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> hath endeavoured to vindicate the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of our <hi>Superiors</hi> againſt his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, therefore he is thus offended; for he finds he ſhall never be able to prove what he calls the <hi>natural Inference</hi> from Dr. <hi>Womocks</hi> words; but let us ſee what it amounts to.</p>
            <pb n="160" facs="tcp:66530:82"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Since therefore</hi> (ſays this <hi>Reconciler) no Authority can be ſuppoſed to interpoſe to determine our</hi> Superiors to the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>of theſe</hi> indifferent things, <q>
                  <hi>or to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their</hi> abatement <hi>of them by the ſame power which impoſed them, in order to prevent the ruine of ſo many ſouls as are involved in a wretched</hi> Schiſm <hi>by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of that</hi> Impoſition, <hi>ſince they declare, 'tis in their own choice</hi> and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>to command, or not to command them; this caſe muſt by his own confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be good</hi> againſt the Impoſition <hi>of them, tho it does not hold good againſt</hi> obedience to them, <hi>when Impoſed.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In which words of his there are very many things obſervable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis a great truth, That the caſe he puts does not <hi>hold good</hi> againſt <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to the things in difference among us, <hi>when impoſed.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>That</hi> 'tis good againſt the <hi>Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of them, is <hi>not the</hi> Drs. <hi>Confeſſion</hi> but his own <hi>Inference; which the Doctor</hi> is confident he can never make good; being but one of his uſual <hi>Paralogiſms</hi> and <hi>falſe Reaſonings.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. He confeſſeth that this <hi>wretched Schiſm</hi> of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> is <hi>damnable;</hi> otherwiſe, how could he object the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine

            <p n="4">4.

               </q> what does he mean? a new occaſional and <hi>prophetical Authority?</hi> that needs not; for they have an <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Apoſtolical Authority</hi> (ſuch as is<note place="margin">John 20. 21.</note> conferred upon <hi>Church-Governors</hi>) and that's derived from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and they have their own <hi>humane</hi> Judgment, with the advice of <hi>Common Council</hi> (wherein<note place="margin">Acts 15. 28.</note> matters of ſuch a general and publick concern ſhould be determined) and that is aſſiſted by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and this determines the caſe according to that<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. laſt.</note>

            <p>But I humbly conceive our <hi>Governors</hi> will find many Reaſons not to reſcind the Laws eſtabliſh'd not to reſtrain, or
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:66530:86"/> abate the force of their <hi>Impoſitions</hi> as this <hi>Reconciler</hi> would have them.</p>
            <p>1. They ſhould betray the <hi>Supream power</hi> and <hi>Prerogative</hi> of Authority? 'Tis a Rule laid down by a great Divine, <hi>De facto lex humana obligat,</hi> Humane Law does bind <hi>de Facto,</hi> with a <hi>Non obſtante</hi> to any danger whatſoever, when the <hi>tranſgreſſion of the Law</hi> would fall out to the <hi>ruine</hi> of the <hi>Community,</hi> to the <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>Religion or the Chriſtian Faith,</hi> or to the leſſening and <hi>deſpiſing</hi> of Authority or <hi>the Legiſlative Power.</hi> In ſuch Caſes no fear of danger can excuſe the tranſgreſſion of the Law.</p>
            <p>Upon this ground the <hi>General</hi> does expoſe the <hi>Sentinel</hi> to <hi>imminent</hi> danger of death, to preſerve the whole <hi>Camp,</hi> or <hi>City</hi> from deſtruction. The <hi>Prince</hi> commands a <hi>Phyſician</hi> to attend a place that is viſited with a <hi>raging Peſtilence.</hi> And the Biſhop injoyns a <hi>Prieſt</hi> in the like caſe of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to <hi>adminiſter</hi> to the <hi>Ghoſtly</hi> welfare of ſuch as are under a great Contagion.</p>
            <p>Where, according to the judgment of wiſe men, the advantage and benefit does <hi>preponderate</hi> and outweigh the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or detriment that may inſue, there, it is the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of Authority to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe for the more <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſafety.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="169" facs="tcp:66530:86"/>
            <p>But in ſuch Caſes, the <hi>obligation</hi> does not properly ariſe from the <hi>Humane Law,</hi> but from the <hi>Natural Divine</hi> Law, which forbids that act, which tends to the <hi>contempt</hi> of the Faith and the <hi>deſpiſing</hi> of Religion, or to the <hi>ruine</hi> of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,</hi> or the <hi>undervaluing of Authority</hi> and the <hi>Legiſlative Power:</hi> For ſuch an Act, without doubt, is <hi>intrinſecally</hi> evil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Authority</hi> and the <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> is a <hi>Counterpart</hi> of Gods <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum,</hi> a ſacred Truſt, for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, and to keep <hi>diſtinct Communities</hi> in Peace and Order. As God allows no man to deſpiſe it, ſo it ought much leſs, to deſpiſe it ſelf. And nothing can make it more deſpicable than to ſtoop to a <hi>Lure</hi> of <hi>Feathers,</hi> that is thrown out by a giddy Multitude.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe we have the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Learned and wiſe King <hi>James;</hi> who, in his Proclamation, <hi>March</hi> 5. in the firſt year of his <hi>Reign,</hi> having given <hi>Reaſons,</hi> why he would not be ſwayed to alteration, in the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Gods Service, by the frivolous ſuggeſtion of any light ſpirit;</hi> he adds this,</p>
            <p>
               <q>Neither are we ignorant of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies that do ariſe in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by admitting Innovation in things
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:66530:87"/> one ſetled by mature Deliberation: and how neceſſary it is to uſe Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in the upholding the publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of States; for that ſuch is the unquietneſs and unſtedfaſtneſs of ſome Diſpoſitions, affecting every year new Forms of things, as if they ſhould be followed in their inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, would make all actions of State Ridiculous and Contemptible: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſtedfaſt maintaining of things, by advice eſtabliſhed, is the weal of all Common-wealths.</q> And that reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of King <hi>James</hi> was in the matter of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which we diſcourſe of.</p>
            <p>And the truth is, if the Prince be brought to thoſe <hi>Terms,</hi> that he muſt <hi>ſtrike Sail</hi> to the humour of the <hi>People,</hi> and vary his <hi>Compaſs</hi> according to every <hi>wind of Doctrine</hi> that blows from a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican</hi> Coaſt, he muſt at laſt leave <hi>the fifth Commandment</hi> out of the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has done the <hi>ſecond</hi>) or give them leave to do by it (as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did of old) <hi>to make it of none effect by their Traditions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how much the <hi>Prelates</hi> of the Church are concerned herein we may learn from <hi>Joannes Crocius</hi> (for I will
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:66530:87"/> take in no Authority from the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Caſe, that the <hi>Reconciler</hi> may have no occaſion to cavil upon that account) <hi>Miniſter in omni muneris Parte Auctoritatem divinitùs conceſſam tueatur viriliter &amp; modeſtè:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And if <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Governors</hi> ſhould reſcind and <hi>Chop</hi> and <hi>Change</hi> and <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> Laws and Conſtitutions upon the motion and <hi>Impulſe</hi> of a <hi>turbulent</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, this will countenance their <hi>claim</hi> of a ſhare <note n="*" place="margin">For the Fly upon the Wheel thinks that all the duſt is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the force of her agitation.</note> in the <hi>legiſlative power;</hi> which is of too dangerous a <hi>Conſequence</hi> to be ſuffered in a <hi>Monarchy.</hi> I do ſolemnly therefore aver, that in all his Pleas for <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> did never ſet it up above <hi>Authority,</hi> nor allow it to

Let every man be fully perſwaded in his own mind.</hi> Now if our <hi>Governors</hi> be perſwaded in their own mind, that the things eſtabliſh'd among us are <hi>Decent,</hi> as well as <hi>Lawful,</hi> in the performance of <hi>Gods publick Worſhip;</hi> The <hi>Reconciler</hi> will tell them their <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>

And if in favour of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> (as the <hi>Reconciler</hi> would have it) they ſhould <hi>abate</hi> their <hi>Impoſitions,</hi> and enter their <hi>Proteſtations;</hi> they do not eſteem them <hi>ſinful</hi> to be practiſed, nor <hi>abate</hi> them upon that account. This would not at all <hi>Correct</hi> the Judgment of the <hi>Diſſenters:</hi> but it would tell all the World that ſuch <hi>Governors renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> their own <hi>Judgment,</hi> and 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable many would ſay, they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their <hi>Conſcience,</hi> to humour a <hi>froward</hi> and unſteady <hi>Faction.</hi>

            <p>3. In abating thoſe <hi>Impoſitions</hi> as this <hi>Reconciler</hi> requires, they ſhould betray the truth of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> in things <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> and depretiate the ſolemn <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which among us is determined to be moſt <hi>Decently</hi> and <hi>Reverently</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by our preſent <hi>eſtabliſhment:</hi> we ſay (according to the ſenſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) He that has a jealouſie he ſhall diſpleaſe God, in doing ſuch or ſuch a thing, and yet, will venture to do it, he ſins in it; becauſe he ſhews a want of Reverence to the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> In like manner ſhould we change that <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Worſhip</hi> which we think better for that which we think worſe, a more decent way and manner

            <p>4. Taking away of thoſe <hi>Impoſitions</hi> would cauſe a <hi>greater Miſchief</hi> than it would prevent; For (1.) inſtead of a Paſſive it would procure an <hi>Active Scandal;</hi> to prevent a <hi>Scandal</hi> taken there would be a <hi>Scandal</hi> given: A <hi>Scandal per ſe</hi> laid in our Neighbours way to remove a <hi>Scandal per Accidens.</hi> For a <hi>Scandal</hi> by <hi>Accident</hi> does happen, <hi>Quando nec operantis intentio, nec operis natura aut circumſtantia eò tendit, ut alter ruat, ſed prava peccantis diſpoſitione fit, ut occaſionem peccandi inde hauriat, ubi non eſt:</hi>

            <p>Whereas the Repealing or ruffling of theſe <hi>Impoſitions,</hi> would unſettle a well eſtabliſh'd <hi>Church,</hi> and rob her of that which is her <hi>Glory, her good Order</hi> which keeps her ſtedfaſt in her Faith and <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi> both to God and man.

            <p>(2.) A ſecond Miſchief that would ariſe from the <hi>Retrenching</hi> of thoſe <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi> would be the <hi>Offence</hi> given to the weak and tender <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> For we muſt not deny but we have thoſe that are weak and tender, and are not the worſe for it, and they may very well be jealous with a Godly Jealouſie, if they ſhould ſee ſuch a Change, ſuch an <hi>abolition</hi> of our eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd <hi>Ordinances,</hi> they might very well be <hi>Jealous</hi> of the truth of our <hi>Doctrine</hi> about things <hi>indifferent, jealous</hi> of the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:66530:91"/> lawfulneſs of our Practice herein; or elſe <hi>Jealous</hi> of our ſincerity in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of them both.</p>
            <p>And this might prove ſo great a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> might make a greater Harveſt of it, than they could of all the <hi>Plundering</hi> and <hi>Perſecuting</hi> times of the late <hi>Rebellion,</hi> when men of worth and honour did ſtedfaſtly adhere to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> out of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, finding them ſo juſt and ſteadfaſt to their own well ſetled <hi>Principles.</hi> And that of the <hi>Father</hi> is a known truth, <hi>Ipſa mutatio conſuetudinis, etiam quae adjuvat u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitate, novitate perturbat.</hi> The Change of an old Cuſtom gives more trouble and diſturbance by the novelty, than it can give advantage otherwiſe. <q>And if it be <hi>Inſolentiſſimae Inſaniae,</hi> a part of moſt inſolent madneſs to diſpute any of thoſe Cuſtoms, which the Church ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves all the World over,</q> as St, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> ſays it is; then certainly, no man that is well in his wits, or has any vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for <hi>Gods Church,</hi> can think it a piece of Prudence or ſobriety, to Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate and make void all, and throw them promiſcuouſly out of doors, upon the ſrivolous ſuggeſtions of <hi>Fanatick</hi> Spirits <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66530:91"/> much blind Paſſion and Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>(3.) There is a third Miſchief as great as the former; by this means, <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors</hi> ſhould encourage and harden them in their <hi>Schiſm,</hi> whom, in Charity they are obliged to correct; and not in their <hi>Schiſm</hi> only, but in their <hi>Judaiſm</hi> and <hi>Superſtition;</hi> which is againſt that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we owe to them as well as that which we owe to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>For that they are guilty of a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Schiſm</hi> the <hi>Reconciler</hi> does acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and that they have a tincture of <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> or <hi>Jewiſh Superſtition</hi> (if they do really believe the Principles they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon in this diſpute) cannot be denied as long as they take Sanctuary at <hi>Rome,</hi> and intitle themſelves to the <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> (in this Epiſtle) to the <hi>Diſſenting Chriſtians,</hi> which did then and there converſe. For that ſuch was their Diſtemper and Diſeaſe has been ſufficiently proved already.</p>
            <p>Now to take off theſe <hi>Impoſitions</hi> (which the Party is thus upon the fret, and in fermentation about them) may be againſt that <hi>Charity</hi> we owe to them; and it may be in us the ſin of <hi>ſcandal</hi> too, becauſe we ſhould not be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:66530:92"/> careful to remove the occaſion of ſin from them. This was the ſin of <hi>Eli, 1 Sam.</hi> 3. 13. and the ſin of the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Church of Thyatira. Apoc.</hi> 2. 20. 'Tis an authentic Rule, <hi>Qui non vetat peccare, cum poſſit, jubet;</hi> and that is of the ſame importance; <hi>Facti culpam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, qui quod poteſt, negligit emendare:</hi> He that has power to correct a Fault, is guilty if he neglects to correct it.</p>
            <p>I may add this alſo, that they, to whom we are ſo indulgent, leſt they ſhould be offended, will certainly take occaſion to be offended, and be actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcandalized thereby; and ſo by our <hi>Indulgence</hi> we ſhall ſin doubly; that is, as well againſt that <hi>Charity</hi> which we owe to them, as againſt that which we owe to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>1. Againſt that which we owe unto our ſelves; for if we neglect our <hi>Duty,</hi> when it is incumbent upon us, to <hi>correct</hi> them, that neglect is our ſin, and that is againſt the <hi>Charity</hi> which we owe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>our ſelves;</hi> to prevent which, our Saviour has given us this Charge, <hi>If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off and caſt it from thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. 'Tis certainly againſt that <hi>Charity</hi> we owe to them; for we ſhould hereby
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:66530:92"/> 
               <hi>incourage</hi> them in their <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition</hi> by our <hi>Indulgence,</hi> whereas in <hi>Charity</hi> we are obliged to endeavour their <hi>Correction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If our <hi>Governors</hi> be obliged to root <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Judaiſm</hi> out of the minds and practice of their ſubjects, then they can find no better Remedy than theſe <hi>Impoſitions,</hi> which, as their <hi>Application</hi> has diſcovered the Diſeaſe, ſo the <hi>Continuance</hi> thereof, will be the beſt way to <hi>correct</hi> and <hi>cure</hi> it.</p>
            <p>And for this our bleſſed Saviour hath afforded us an <hi>example;</hi> for, why did<note place="margin">Luke 13. 32. &amp; 33.</note> he work ſo many Cures upon the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> day, which he knew ſo highly to <hi>Scandalize</hi> and offend the <hi>Jews?</hi> The day of it ſelf was <hi>indifferent</hi> to him (<hi>I caſt out Devils and do Cures to day and to morrow and the day following</hi>) He could have done it the day before, or the day after; why then did he ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and ſo <hi>deſignedly</hi> work his Cures upon the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day? Why, it was to <hi>detect</hi> the <hi>Superſtition</hi> they had for the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day and to cure them of it. And herein the <hi>Reconciler</hi> and I are perfectly agreed: for he ſaith, our <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour is ſuppoſed to have taken this</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prot. Recotcil. pag. 318.</note> 
               <hi>occaſion, (viz.</hi>) to heal the diſeaſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:66530:93"/> the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath) <hi>to deliver the poor People from thoſe ſuperſtitions,</hi> and <hi>heavy burdens, which the Phariſees had laid upon them in reference to that day.</hi> In like manner, the great <hi>Prudence</hi> of our Governors thinks fit to continue theſe <hi>healing Impoſitions,</hi> to deliver our poor people from thoſe <hi>Superſtitions</hi> and burdens, which our modern <hi>Phariſees the Presbyterian Divines,</hi> have laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in reference to theſe very <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Governors do well remember their own office and know they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to do, than to humour a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious or froward people. They are <hi>Miniſters of Gods Kingdom:</hi> They have<note place="margin">Wiſ. 6.</note> a <hi>Maſter</hi> in Heaven who is <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> to whom they muſt be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for their adminiſtrations, he claims a Sovereignty over them as intitled to their <hi>Thrones</hi> by the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> which he gives them: <hi>By Me Kings Reign;</hi> and<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> as he allows them to Reign by him, ſo he requires they ſhould Reign for him: To this effect, he appoints them to be <hi>Nurſing Fathers</hi> to his Church; and ſuch (God be bleſſed) have been all our <hi>Princes</hi> ſince the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="183" facs="tcp:66530:93"/>
            <p>And the Charge is as ſtrict upon the <hi>Biſhops. Take heed therefore unto your ſelves, and to all the Flock over the which</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 20. 28.</note> 
               <hi>the holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood.</hi> The way to <hi>feed</hi> them is not to flatter, but inſtruct them not to humour their <hi>petulancy</hi> but to reprove it: not to wink at their <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition</hi> but to correct it: They can neither diſcharge their <hi>Duty</hi> nor a good <hi>Conſcience</hi> by following the <hi>People</hi> in their ſtragling; but by bringing them home into the <hi>Fold;</hi> if they gratifie them to their ruine, they cannot do it but with certain peril of their own.</p>
            <p>There is a great difference betwixt a <hi>Looſe</hi> and <hi>unſetled State,</hi> and a <hi>State</hi> that is regularly <hi>eſtabliſh'd:</hi> in the firſt every man does that which is right in his own eyes (<hi>and that perhaps he may call his conſcience</hi>) So we find it, <hi>Jud. 17, 6. In thoſe days there was no King in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</hi> And the meaning of that place, our <hi>Synopſis</hi> has very well diſcovered: <hi>'twas no wonder that Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try crept in amongſt them, when there was no Sovereign like that of Kings to hinder it, for the Judges kept men to their Duty
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66530:94"/> by advice and perſwaſion, rather than by an effectual command and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But may we do ſo now, when we are under a well ſetled <hi>Government?</hi> It may ſeem ſo to our <hi>Reconciler</hi> and his <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> by the Apoſtles Conceſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. according to the <hi>vulgar Latin unuſquiſque ſenſu ſuo abundet, let every man abound in his own ſenſe. But is this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel?</hi> Is this good practical <hi>Divinity?</hi> No, 'tis a corruption of the Text ſaith <hi>Hemmingius,</hi> 'tis wicked and unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, for God hath expreſly forbidden it, <hi>Deut. 12. 8. Ye ſhall not do that which is right in your own eyes.</hi> That is the common <hi>practice</hi> of ſuch as have no <hi>Coercive Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the <hi>attempt</hi> of ſuch as <hi>would have</hi> none: <hi>Wilt thou put out the eyes of theſe men?</hi> Numb. 16. 14. <hi>We will not come up.</hi> They think they have loſt their own eyes, if they may not be allowed to do what they liſt.

            <p>To prevent this, <hi>Governors</hi> are ſet up in the <hi>Church</hi> to determin what is fit to be done, and to reſtrain our vagrant <hi>Liberty</hi> to the uſe and Practice of what is ſo ordained, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 40.

            </p>
            <p>The evidence of truth is ſo ſtrong in<note place="margin">Pag. 340.</note> this Caſe, that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are forced to allow, that <hi>there be many Caſes, where ſomewhat</hi> in genere <hi>is neceſſary to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined;</hi> They alſo add, that in all Caſes truly ſuch, the <hi>Magiſtrate Civil</hi> or <hi>Sacred</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But it is a great miſtake to think that <hi>Authority</hi> in this Caſe is reſtrained to things <hi>Neceſſary: All things are Lawful for me,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>but all things are not expedient.</hi> If he had reſtrained his (or our) Liberty to things <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> he would have argued to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; All things are <hi>Lawful</hi> for me, but all things are not <hi>neceſſary;</hi> and he would<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 12. &amp; 10. 23.</note> have injoyned us to keep to things <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary:</hi> but he argues otherwiſe; <hi>All things are Lawful but all things are not Expedient.</hi> Wherein he teacheth us to diſtinguiſh of things; whereof ſome (ſaith he) are <hi>expedient,</hi> and ſome are <hi>inexpedient.</hi> Which are expedient is not left to every man to judge; for then we ſhould run again into Madneſs and Confuſion, as was obſerved even now.</p>

               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:66530:108"/> at <hi>ſuch a time, or place,</hi> yet he aſſerts it <hi>ſimply</hi> and <hi>abſolutely</hi> as if the agreement were in <hi>every reſpect, in every part, and time, and place without any limitation.</hi> And this is the <hi>Fallacy</hi> that runs all along in the <hi>Reconcilers</hi> Diſcourſe, when he ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the <hi>Fathers</hi> and other Authors, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a <hi>Decent Habit,</hi> a <hi>Reverent Geſture,</hi> or the <hi>Symbolical Sign</hi> of our <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which is the <hi>ſigne</hi> of the <hi>Croſs;</hi> for we may be confident, thoſe Holy <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Authors</hi> (who are quoted by him) would never make ſuch ſharp <hi>Invectives</hi> againſt the Church of God, and their own <hi>Senſe</hi> and conſtant <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. And with this <hi>Fallacy</hi> he urges as well the <hi>example</hi> as the <hi>ſayings</hi> of the great Apoſtle; as if that had bin his conſtant <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome <hi>ſtanding Rule,</hi> which was nothing elſe but his <hi>Condeſcention Pro hîc &amp; Nunc,</hi> at ſome times, and in ſome places, and among ſome Perſons, by <hi>ſpecial Diſpenſation.</hi> And this <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy</hi> he repeats ſo often, that it becomes <hi>Nauſeous.</hi>

            <p>For the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition is drawn out of Holy Scripture, and ſpeaks of Perſons ſo qualified, in ſuch ſort, that the Title of <hi>Weak Brethren</hi> cannot in reaſon be allowed them: And that ſome of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are ſuch, the <hi>Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> does not deny <note n="*" place="margin">V. p. 108.</note>.</p>

            <p>A <hi>Second Degree</hi> of ſuch as have loſt the Title of <hi>Weak Brethren,</hi> is, When a Man, from a modeſt Enquirer, comes to be <hi>poſitive,</hi> and <hi>Dogmatical,</hi> and <hi>Will</hi>

            <p>A <hi>Third Degree</hi> of this ſort of Men, is, When a Man is puft up with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of his own Knowledge, when he becomes a <hi>fierce Diſputant,</hi> grows <hi>Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and Cenſorious, deſpiſeth Dominion,</hi> and takes the <hi>Scorners Chair;</hi> then he commenceth <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> and is not to be treated as a <hi>weak Brother,</hi> but as a <hi>Seditious Mutineer;</hi> for 'tis now evident, That he diſſents not out of <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> but out of <hi>Pride, Stubbornneſs,</hi> and <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſaith the <hi>Reconciler</hi> to this? Why the <hi>Characters</hi> here given of ſuch Perſons are taken ſo to the Life, out of Holy Scripture, that he cannot deny the Truth of them; which makes up the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition: And the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption

            <p>Were the <hi>Reconciler</hi>'s Wits a Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathering when he wrote his Book?

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:66530:111"/> Memory, for in the very next Leaf, within leſs than Four Pages; He takes notice, That the Apoſtle offers no Rules of <hi>Diſcrimination,</hi> as the Doctor doth: If the Doctor offers Rules of Diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, then he does noe paſs Sentence without exception.</p>
            <p>And one <hi>Miſtake,</hi> tho never ſo <hi>abſurd,</hi> does commonly beget another; and ſo it happens here; for, Where is the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy <hi>Sentence</hi> which the Doctor paſſeth? And, What is it? Certainly it cannot be leſs than the Sentence of <hi>Damnation,</hi> which he blames with ſo much noiſe in Dr. <hi>Womock:</hi> I find indeed at every turn, the <hi>Reconciler</hi> is ſending His <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> to <hi>Hell</hi> for their <hi>wretched Schiſme,</hi> not by <hi>ſingle</hi> Perſons only, but by <hi>Sholes and Myriads;</hi> and then he rebukes Dr.<note place="margin">Pag. 55.</note> 
               <hi>Womock</hi> for ſo doing, when he does it not: Juſt as he ſhoots his <hi>Cenſures</hi> at his <hi>Governours,</hi> in the very <hi>ſame</hi> Breath, wherein he inveighs againſt <hi>Judging.</hi>
            </p>

If his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument were put into <hi>Form,</hi> it muſt run thus, <hi>Whoſoever ſaith, That the</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters <hi>have loſt the Title of</hi> Weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>and are under the Sentence of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:66530:111"/> Damnation, he is raſh, Preſumptuous, and Uncharitable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But does Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> make any ſuch Aſſumption? Then let the <hi>Reconciler</hi> (who takes great freedom in that kind) tell him of his <hi>foolery;</hi> and that he wants <hi>Logick</hi> as well as <hi>Charity.</hi> But Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> knows that here is <hi>Sophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Plurium Interrogationum;</hi> which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is more then the <hi>Reconciler</hi> has conſidered. In effect he puts the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thus, Have the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> loſt the Title of <hi>Weak Brethren,</hi> and fallen under the <hi>Sentence of Damnation?</hi> If the Dr. <hi>affirms</hi> it, then he concludes them under the <hi>Sentence of Damnation,</hi> and is raſh and <hi>Uncharitable</hi> in ſo doing: If he <hi>denies</hi> it, then he grants that they are <hi>Weak Brethren,</hi> and are to have all the Indulgence and tenderneſs, that belongs to Perſons under thoſe Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>But Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> is able to diſtinguiſh in this Caſe, and to ſeparate ſuch as have loſt the title of <hi>Weak Brethren</hi> from the preſent ſentence of Damnation. For the Dr. <hi>meddles with</hi> no mans Perſon, having ſo well conſidered the <hi>Advice</hi> of<note place="margin">Biſhop <hi>Taylor.</hi>
               </note> that learned <hi>Prelate</hi> (whom the <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler</hi> pretends to admire, while he does
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:66530:112"/> abuſe him in his writings.) <hi>Be not haſty,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>in pronouncing damnation</hi>
               <note place="margin">Adv. 52.</note> 
               <hi>againſt any man or Party in a matter of Diſputation. It is enough that you reprove an errour; but what ſhall be the ſentence againſt it at the day of Judgment, thou knoweſt not, and therefore pray for the erring Perſon and reprove him, but leave the ſentence to his Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But touching thoſe <hi>Weak ones</hi> among<note place="margin">Ad Rom. 14. in Principio.</note> the <hi>Romans,</hi> I ſhall acquaint the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi> Opinion of them. <q>The queſtion is, Whether the Weakneſs of their Faith were an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to their Juſtification? He thinks not; becauſe it is not the ſtrength or Excellency of our Faith, by which we are juſtified, but the <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> of the <hi>Object;</hi> and although Faith be weak, yet 'tis Faith ſtill if it be true. But it might be ſaid, that they did not believe all things which were to be believed: For they did not believe the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be abrogated: And that Faith, which does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all the Articles of Faith, is no true faith. <hi>Fateor equidem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> I do confeſs it, <hi>Si id accidat vitio Credentis,</hi> if the fault be in the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:66530:112"/> Believer; if he will not admit of thoſe Truths which he hears out of Holy Writ, but contemns them; and makes himſelf the Judge and Arbitrator, how much of Scripture he ought to believe; and attributes more to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then he does to the Word of God: <hi>Non eſt ista Fides vera; that is not true Faith;</hi> nor is the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit wont to inſpire any ſuch Sence or Judgment. But if there be ſomething which a man does not believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it has not been clearly propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him, and he carries a mind ſufficiently prepared to receive the Truth, when it is made known to him; in this caſe the Truth of his Faith may be a means to juſtify, while the Weakneſs of it doth excuſe him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I wiſh the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> may conſider this Judgment of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> that they may not make matters of <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> (under the Goſpel) to be Sin, as if we were ſtill under that <hi>Moſaical</hi> yoak of Bondage, the <hi>Law,</hi> and not under <hi>Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to follow the <hi>Reconciler,</hi> who juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies his <hi>Denial</hi> of the Concluſion by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Arguments.</p>
            <p>1. He ſays, what Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> does<note place="margin">Pag. 105.</note>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:66530:113"/> alledge is a <hi>Plea</hi> that will ſerve all <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties, Papiſts, Diſſenters, Arminians, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,</hi> and almoſt all <hi>Diſputers.</hi> Now what the true ground of the <hi>Diſpute</hi> is I cannot well imagine; I have reaſon to think he is offended with the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> Propoſition, which contains the <hi>Character</hi> of ſuch as ought not to claime the Right or Title of <hi>Weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi> but that is ſo expreſly the words of Holy Scripture, that he cannot in modeſty avow his diſlike thereof; and therefore he makes an <hi>Aſſumption (or Minor</hi> Propoſition) in Dr. <hi>Womocks</hi> name, and then blames him for it. That Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> did not aſſume upon the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi> the <hi>Reader</hi> will be convinced,<note place="margin">v. Pag. 100. 101, 102.</note> if he pleaſe to conſult the place in the <hi>Verdict.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However let us weigh the ſtrength of his diſcourſe which we have in this <hi>Syllogiſme:</hi> All Arguments that may be uſed by other Parties, as <hi>Papiſts,</hi> &amp;c. they are ill Arguments: But Dr. <hi>Womocks</hi> Argument may be uſed by other Parties, <hi>Papiſts,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore 'tis an ill Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Here I deny his <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition: All Arguments uſed by other <hi>Parties,</hi> and particularly by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> are not
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:66530:113"/> ill Arguments; for their Arguments to prove the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Chriſt are good Arguments, and many of them the very ſame that are uſed by <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> And that of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is celebrated for a great Truth among all the Learned, even by <hi>Ameſius</hi> himſelf: <hi>Propter incertitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem proprioe juſtitioe, &amp; perticulum inanis gloriae, tutiſſimum eſt fiduciam totam in ſola Dei miſericordiâ &amp; benignitate reponere:</hi> that is, In regard of the Uncertainty of our own Righteouſneſs, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Vain-glory, it is the ſafeſt way to put our whole Truſt and Confidence, in the ſole Mercy and Favour of God. This is a great Goſpel-Truth, and yet it fell from the Pen of <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> And therefore he is out of the ſtory, when he concludes <hi>all</hi> Arguments to be ill, becauſe they are uſed by <hi>Papiſts</hi> or other <hi>Parties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That his Argument may conclude effectually againſt Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> it muſt be framed thus: Thoſe Arguments which will as well, and with <hi>equal Truth and Light of evidence,</hi> maintain the <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as they do the Doctrine of the</hi> Church <hi>of England, Thoſe muſt needs be ill Arguments: But ſuch are the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments produced by Dr.</hi> Womock.</p>
            <pb n="236" facs="tcp:66530:114"/>
            <p>Here I utterly deny the <hi>Minor:</hi> The Argumens there uſed by Dr. <hi>Womock,</hi> have not an <hi>equal Truth</hi> or <hi>Light of Evidence</hi> to prove the <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> as they have to prove the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> For let me ask the <hi>Reconciler</hi> theſe few Queſtions: Have the Popiſh Party as good Reaſon for their Averſion to our <hi>Communion,</hi> as we have for our Averſion to theirs? Have they as great Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt us, as we have againſt them? Has the <hi>Pope</hi> any lawful <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> over us? By what <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Council</hi> was it ſettled? Did we break off from their <hi>Communion?</hi> Or rather, Did not they <hi>leave</hi> and <hi>interdict</hi> Ours? Who is now the Friend to <hi>Jeſuites?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would have the <hi>Reconciler</hi> to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That although the ſame <hi>Sentence</hi> for Words and Syllables, may paſs againſt an <hi>Innocent</hi> as well as againſt a <hi>Malefactor,</hi> yet I hope he will not ſay, it is done with <hi>equal</hi> Truth and Juſtice. But he is ſo ingenuous at laſt, as to confeſs the truth in theſe words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It will be hard to ſhew, why either Party may not almoſt with equal plauſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pr. <hi>Recon.</hi> p. 107.</note> 
               <hi>make this pretence.</hi> Whence we muſt conclude, that this his Argument (like the reſt of his Book) is but <hi>almost</hi> to the purpoſe.</p>

            <p>2.

            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this third Intreaty, I have many things to offer towards a Satisfaction: But this I learn from the <hi>Reconciler</hi> in general.</p>
            <p>That ſuch as err out of <hi>pure Malice, Pride, Affection, Animoſity, Stubborneſs,</hi> and <hi>Frowardneſs, are</hi> a <hi>Pack</hi> of <hi>Damned Villains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This the <hi>Reconciler</hi> makes a <hi>Major</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: And for a <hi>Minor,</hi> or Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he declares thus, <hi>We have cauſe to</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>fear the thing is too true, that among the Body of Diſſenters, there be Men of this
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:66530:125"/> malicious, proud, ſtubborn Temper.</hi> The Concluſion then from thence ſhould be this; Therefore <hi>We have cauſe to fear, that amongſt the Body of Diſſenters there is a pack of Damned Villains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> ever let fall any Expreſſion againſt the <hi>Generality</hi> of the <hi>Diſſenters ſo rudely Cenſorious,</hi> he appeals to every Man that has read the <hi>Verdict.</hi> But the <hi>Reconciler,</hi> to take off the <hi>Odium</hi> of ſuch an Inference from himſelf, has the Confidence to deny the Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But knowing this (as I ſuppoſe) to be moſt groſly abſurd in the <hi>Schools</hi> of Learning, He affixes an <hi>Univerſal</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Pag. 108.</note> Dr. <hi>Womock,</hi> as if he had affirm'd, That all the <hi>Diſſenters (to a Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception) are Proud, Froward, Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, and Malicious; that they all Sin out of pure Willfulneſs and Obſtinacy, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed Malice and Deſign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus he plays with Dr. <hi>Womock</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, to ſpring his own <hi>Game.</hi> For upon that falſe Principle, he Argues for ſix Leaves together: But Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> challenges it as a piece of Juſtice from him, either to make good his <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Propoſition</hi> againſt him, or elſe to wear the <hi>Brand</hi> of a <hi>Notorious Slanderer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Till the <hi>Reconciler</hi> has acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:66530:125"/> of this, Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> has reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to neglect his <hi>Harangues,</hi> upon ſuch <hi>falſe</hi> Suppoſitions, as impertinent; but as well to entertain the Reader, as to take occaſion to aſſert the Truth, I ſhall make ſome other Remarks upon what he has here ſuggeſted.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whereas he ſayes, <hi>We, who are</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 19. 6. 1 Cor. 5. 4. cap. 14. 37. 2 Cor. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Parties, are left to judge;</hi> He is in a great Miſtake: The Governours of the <hi>Church</hi> are in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>ſtead,</hi> in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their <hi>Miniſterial Office,</hi> of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> In this their <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Capacity,</hi> they judge not for <hi>Man,</hi> but for the <hi>Lord;</hi> they act as Chriſt's <hi>Stewards,</hi> and not as <hi>Parties</hi> in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Sectaries:</hi> And for that Reaſon they are to be obeyed <hi>for the Lord's ſake;</hi> though in their <hi>Perſonal capacity,</hi> they are ſubject to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Church, as well as other Men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Reconciler</hi> jumbles Things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of ſo diſtant a Nature and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that it is very reaſonable to believe, his Deſign was to amuſe, and not to inſtruct and edify his Reader.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He ſeems to have a greater Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> than the <hi>Lutherans:</hi> He can afford them the Title of <hi>Learned Papiſts:</hi> But contemns the <hi>Lutherans</hi> all
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:66530:126"/> along, as <hi>miſerable</hi> and <hi>fooliſh Triflers:</hi> Nay, he has brought in St. <hi>Paul</hi> among the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> formerly, and here we ſhall find him again rankt among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Adverſaries;</hi> ſo that in time he may poſſibly ſet up for a <hi>Papiſt Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler,</hi> and I believe his <hi>common place</hi> Book is furniſhed with <hi>Materials</hi> for ſuch a Work, as well as for this, which he has put out under another Title.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In Reference to the ſeveral <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> he mentions, Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> would ſay, there has not been ſufficient ſaid to convince them of their Errours; if others had not ſaid more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to confute them, than this <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. If <hi>Con-ſubſtantiation</hi> be a fooliſh Doctrine, yet 'tis but a <hi>Metaphyſical Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,</hi> and ſo innocent of its own Nature, it never brake the <hi>Peace</hi> in that Communion wherein 'tis entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Tho this <hi>Reconciler</hi> would fain get into the <hi>Chair,</hi> and paſs his <hi>Sentence,</hi> we pretend not to judge ſuch as are not within our own <hi>Juriſdiction.</hi> Let them <hi>Stand</hi> or <hi>Fall</hi> to their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective <hi>Maſters;</hi> 'tis enough when we have occaſion to conſider their <hi>Tenents,</hi>

Why, Did <hi>Soto</hi> ever write againſt the <hi>Church of England?</hi> He preſented his Book <hi>de Naturâ</hi> and <hi>Gratiâ,</hi> to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> whereof he was a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and it's like he writes ſomething therein againſt the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> whoſe Doctrines this <hi>Reconciler</hi> contemns as <hi>fooliſh</hi> and <hi>trifling;</hi> and ſo as for as we can ſee, he is as much an <hi>Advocate</hi> for the <hi>Roman Party,</hi> as their Adverſary.</p>
            <p>But, What is his Quarrel to the <hi>Rule?</hi> Will no <hi>Rule</hi> ſerve his turn, but ſuch a one as is without Exception? Where ſhall we find it? But let us give <hi>Soto</hi>'s <hi>Rule</hi> fair Play, and let it ſpeak for it ſelf. <hi>He is ſuppoſed to Err through Malice, who has been ſo far admoniſhed, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not justly pretend Ignorance; or may eaſily be convinced of it.</hi> Can there be any
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:66530:127"/> thing ſaid more <hi>rational?</hi> If he cannot pretend <hi>ignorance,</hi> or may eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of it, and yet will perſiſt in his <hi>errour:</hi> Then his Fault proceeds not from the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of his <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> but from the <hi>Pravity</hi> or corrupt Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Will, which the <hi>School-Men</hi> call <hi>Malice.</hi> For <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize</hi> can have no place or pretence here, where things are done with ſo much Deliberation, and continued in againſt a <hi>Known Law,</hi> and a <hi>juſt Authority,</hi> as well as againſt <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>publick</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions; and when <hi>ſtubborneſs</hi> is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> then, of a <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Choice</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> it becomes <hi>Hereſy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Why did the <hi>Reconciler</hi> ſingle out <hi>Soto</hi> to the Combate, when <hi>Perkins</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> were in the ſame <hi>File</hi> on the <hi>Front,</hi> and on the <hi>Rear</hi> of him, and<note place="margin">

            <p>Such Tranſgreſſions as our <hi>Reconciler</hi> undertakes to Excuſe, or Vindicate, are hardly conſiſtent with Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of <hi>weak Ones.

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:66530:128"/>
'tis out of ſimple Ignorance, or bad Cuſtom;</hi> and 'twill laſt no longer than <hi>till they be better inform'd: but if, after a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Information, they hold and practice bad things;</hi> 'tis then of <hi>willful Ignorance,</hi> and of <hi>Malice;</hi> and in that caſe, He calls them <hi>Obstinate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for St. <hi>Paul</hi> his <hi>decretory</hi> Sentence is this, <hi>A man that is an Heretick, after</hi>

            </p>

               <q>But what is the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi> concerned herein?

            </p>
            <p>We now underſtand, ſaith Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> whom the Apoſtle means by a <hi>Heretick;</hi> but we are not to determine, who is ſuch a <hi>Heretick,</hi> or to reject him till we have firſt indeavoured to reduce him to a ſound Judgment. <q>He muſt have a <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> Admonition, not from <hi>Private</hi> Perſons, but from the <hi>Publick</hi> Authority and Miniſtry of the Church; for the Words of the Apoſtle do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thus much, <hi>Graviter quaſi cenſoria correctione reprimendos eſſe.</hi>
               </q> That ſuch Perſons are ſharply to be reſtrained by the Rod of Diſcipline; for he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of <hi>himſelf,</hi> becauſe being ſo<note place="margin">Hyperius.</note> carefully inſtructed and ſo frequently admoniſhed, He has no body to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute his condemnation to, but to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his own Malice.</p>

            <p>What the Judgment of the moſt Learned and Pious <hi>Proteſtants</hi> was a <hi>Hundred</hi> years agoe, I ſhall give you<note place="margin">Ad Titum. 3. 10, 11.</note> the account from <hi>Bullinger,</hi> to whom <hi>Hyperius</hi> alſo refers his Reader. That <hi>Bullinger</hi> was a man of ſo great Eſteem, that his <hi>Decades</hi> were tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and thought fit to be read in the Publick <hi>Congregations,</hi> where they wanted able Preachers; and this Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of his paſſed for Currant, till the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian Hereſy</hi> (which does ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preach the <hi>Satisfaction, Merits</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> of our Saviour) prevail'd ſo much among us: And this has hapned; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Canons</hi> of 1640. were not duely enforced to prevent the <hi>growth</hi> of it. But to return to the buſineſs in hand.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give the ſence of <hi>Bullinger</hi> in<note place="margin">Hen. Bullinger Commentar. in omnes Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Epiſtolas</note> a clear Tranſlation of his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the Text which begins thus.</p>

            </q>
            <p>
               <q>Some perhaps may ask, what I
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:66530:130"/> would do with Him that obeyes not<note place="margin">Tiguri. 1582. Hic Ad Titum. 3. 10, 11.</note> the Truth, but continues to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, and to ſtir up Faction? The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> anſwers, after the firſt and ſecond <hi>Admonition,</hi> if he will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey your advice, take heed, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate your ſelf from ſuch an hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Deplorato.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But adding the Reaſon, why he commands Us to abbor the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Fellowſhip of ſuch an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,</hi> He ſayes, He that is ſuch a one as will not admit of good Advice, is rather exaſperated by continual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, and can never be brought to embrace the Truth: For a ſimple Errour is quickly healed, but Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſs is uncurable. But ſuch a Man is ſubverted by Prejudice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſwerves from the true Faith, and being intangled in Perplexity, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in invincible Ignorance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Hereupon <hi>Theophylact,</hi> explaining theſe words, ſayes, The <hi>Apostle</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands by an <hi>Heretick,</hi> an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible Fellow, and one that is on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſide ſo entangled with Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that He knows not which way to free himſelf. Therefore, ſuch a One will never be perſwaded to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:66530:131"/> the Truth, but rather attempt to draw his Charitable Adviſer into his own Opinion. Wherefore here is a great deal of Danger, but little Hope.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>For when <hi>Hereticks</hi> are ſo wicked, and hardned in thoſe Things which are manifeſtly Falſe; there's none, or very ſmall Hopes of their recovering; nay, on the contrary, it oftentimes happens, That they impoſe upon him, who adviſes them, if weak, though otherwiſe a good honeſt Man: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, He adviſedly commands, that they ſhould be avoided.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But ſome perhaps will Object, That it is a ſad thing, if we ſhould thus neglect the Sheep that is gone aſtray, our Lord did not ſo; it's to be feared, his Deſtruction will be required at our Hands: The <hi>Apostle</hi> anſwers, If ſuch a Man Periſh, he periſheth not by your Fault, but by his own; for, Why did he not obey his Teacher?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Moreover, they that gather from hence, That it is againſt the Scriptures for the Civil Magiſtrate to reſtrain <hi>Hereticks;</hi> that is to ſay, not only ſuch as are perverted from the Faith, but ſuch as Study to pervert others: They
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:66530:131"/> do not conſider, That the <hi>Apostle</hi> here doth not Diſpute about the Offices of a Lawful Magiſtrate, but what the <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſhould do. For in theſe, and other of the <hi>Apostle</hi>'s Preſcriptions, the Occaſion is to be conſider'd. But they'l ſay, The <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Command is, Not Compel, or Kill, but avoid an <hi>Heretick:</hi> It's very true: For no Man is raſhly to be Condemned or Rejected, but rather to be Endeared and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. This is the peculiar Work of <hi>Biſhops.</hi> But if after ſuch an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable and endearing Treatment and Admonition, he refuſeth to Repent, and endeavours ſtill to draw whole Multitudes into the ſame Sedition and Ruine with himſelf; Here again it is the <hi>Biſhops</hi> concern, not only to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that ſetitious Doctrine and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, but alſo to lay down his Life for the Sheep, againſt the aſſaults and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of ſuch Wolves; to defend and preſerve his Flock with the Sword of Truth, and manfully to Repel and Subdue them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had written an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> or <hi>Sergius,</hi> and had inform'd them of their Duties, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, He would have injoyn'd
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:66530:132"/> them to defend the Congregation of the Faithful, and to reſtrain thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching Wolves. For we ſee St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſmote the falſe-Prophet <hi>Barjeſus</hi> with Blindneſs, becauſe he endeavour'd obſtinately to maintain a Falſhood, and to reject the Truth. And if an <hi>Heretick</hi> is only to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and not alſo to be puniſhed; Why did the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſmite <hi>Elymas</hi> with Blindneſs? Why did our Lord Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to take the falſe-Prophet from among the Living? But you will ſay He Commanded theſe things under the Law? True; But <hi>Magistracy</hi> was not Abrogated with the Law; for now as well as then 'tis the Gift of God. Beſides, the Liberty of the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs<note place="margin">Tim. 1. 9, 10.</note> only to them that walk after the Law. Wherefore ſeeing we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to receive the Law in all things which are not Repugnant to the Goſpel, or to ſound Doctrine, no Man whatſoever under any pretence of the Goſpel, ſhall ever obtain of us to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer falſe-Doctrine, to encreaſe in the Church of God without reſtraint.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Theſe are very true and plauſible Sayings (to wit) That Faith is the Gift of God: That Faith is not wrought
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:66530:132"/> in any Man by the Power of the Sword; but theſe ſignify nothing to the preſent purpoſe. For we do not ſpeak concerning Internal Faith as the Gift of God; but concerning the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Faith, as the Profeſſion of our Religion, which we deſire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, not ſo much by reſtraining their Incredulity, nor their Opinions as falſe, but as they become infectious. I confeſs, Faith and Unbelief are of the Heart, no Man can judge of them; but by Men's Words and overt Actions,</q> we may judge of them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>St. <hi>Augustin</hi> was ſometime of that<note place="margin">Auguſt. advin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Epiſt. <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine 48.</hi>
                  </note> Opinion, That <hi>Hereticks</hi> were to be dealt with, only by the Word of God; but he afterwards confeſſed, That many Reaſons and Examples had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with him, to be of another Perſwaſion. But, What need ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Words? The Church, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Truth, muſt neceſſarily be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted and defended from Errours; Blaſphemies are to be puniſhed; and we muſt take care of the Sound Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, that they be not infected by the Rotten. But the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of performing this, Godly Zeal, the judgment of Faith, and Chriſtian
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:66530:133"/> Charity muſt preſcribe; that herein we do nothing, either too much, or too little.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>'Tis the <hi>Biſhop's</hi> Duty to warn, to reſtrain, and to uſe all Opportunity and Importunity to gain him that is out of the Way: But if in contempt of the Truth, he ſhall ſtill go on in the Errour of his Wayes; and alſo ſtrive to draw others with him into the ſame Errour; then his Stubbornneſs and Errour is to be refuted by the Word of Truth, in the Face of the Church; and care to be taken, leſt any one ſhould give credit to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Beſides, the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> alſo is to be put in mind (if he be remiſs, and the Wolf proceeds more and more to infeſt the People of God) to have a greater care of God's Flock, that the Wolves may not ſet upon them. For ſuch Miſchiefs are to be removed from the People of God, who, as much as is poſſible, are to be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> The Puniſhment is to be inflicted upon Offenders, not for their Ruin, but Salvation, (to wit) that they may repent.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="275" facs="tcp:66530:133"/>
            <p>
               <q>Nor are we preſently to proceed to a Capital Puniſhment againſt thoſe that are in Errour, or infected with <hi>Heretical</hi> Pravity, but when their Blaſphemies are ſo Execrable, that they cannot be born with, without reproach to God; Or when the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of Erring, does manifeſtly tend to the Subverſion of Religion, and the Laws Eſtabliſhed, and they are openly and truly convicted hereof. For there is a great Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him that doth not Err out of Malice, and him who Errs willfully, and out of a deſign to do Miſchief.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Nor are all Offences to be <hi>Capital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Puniſhed; for ſometimes the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is <hi>Corporal,</hi> ſometime <hi>Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary,</hi> as the Quality of the Offence, and the Equity of the Law ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Learned <hi>Protestant</hi> was of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That in certain Caſes, the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi> ſhould Aſſiſt the <hi>Biſhop</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>Sectaries.</hi> And ſuch a one he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts him that is a <hi>Broacher</hi> of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable <hi>Blaſphemies,</hi> to the high Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Almighty God, and whoſe ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and ſeditious Practices, do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly tend to the <hi>Subverſion of Religion,

            <p>And thus much of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Rule, which the <hi>Reconciler</hi> would make his <hi>Reader</hi> believe, was onely a <hi>Rule</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed by Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> from our <hi>Roman</hi> Adverſaries.</p>

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:66530:135"/> this Rule; which concerns onely ſuch as have forfeited that Title, and the Priviledge which belongs to it. But let us hear his Reaſon, ſuch as it is.</p>
            <p>
               <q>For when the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> queſtioned the Power of our Lord, (as Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us they did in many places,) does not our <hi>Saviours</hi> Reproof of this their Unbelief, inform us, That they had ſufficient Reaſon from what he had already done before their eyes, to be convinced of it? When they doubted of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> or rather disbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, had they not had ſufficient Cauſe both from <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and their <hi>Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> frequent words, to lay aſide that Doubt? When that after our Lords Commiſſion to <hi>Go and Preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to all Nations,</hi> and the Deſcent of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> not only they, but the whole Church held it unlawful to Preach the Goſpel to any but the <hi>Jews,</hi> or to the <hi>Circumciſed,</hi> could they juſtly pretend Ignorance after ſo plain an Admonition? Were not the Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Chriſtians ſufficiently admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, by the Holy Ghoſts falling on <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his Friends, and the Diſcourſes at the <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> That there was no neceſſity of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:66530:136"/> the <hi>Gentile Chriſtians,</hi> or of refuſing to Converſe with the Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed? And muſt not only they but <hi>Peter</hi> alſo and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> be <hi>Stubborn</hi> and <hi>Malitious</hi> for acting contrary to it?</q> I ſhall repeat no more of this <hi>Harangue</hi> to ſpare my ſelf as well as the <hi>Reader.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we have <hi>Fallacy</hi> again; ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of different kinds jumbled together, that no ſingle Anſwer can comprehend them. And this is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign of Impoſture; <hi>Dolus verſatur in Univerſalibus.</hi> But I hope we ſhall give ſuch a general <hi>Solution</hi> as will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the Judicious.</p>
            <p>1. We are to conſider, That the <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> of the Goſpel was ſtupendious, and all <hi>Myſtery:</hi> The <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the Son of<note place="margin">1 Tim 3. 16.</note> God was a <hi>Myſtery:</hi> The <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt from the Dead was a <hi>Myſtery;</hi> The calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was a <hi>Mystery;</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets forth in theſe words: <hi>Even the Myſtery which hath been hid from Ages, and from Generations, but</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>now is made manifeſt to the Saints, to whom God would make known, what is the riches of the Glory of this Myſtery among the Gentiles, which is Chriſt in you the hope of Glory.</hi> Of the whole <hi>Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> the Prophet cries out. <hi>Who hath</hi>

               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:66530:136"/> 
               <hi>believed our report? or to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</hi> And again. <hi>Behold ye among the Heathen and regard,</hi>

               <hi>and wonder marvellouſly: for I will work a Work in your dayes, which ye will not believe tho it be told you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. We are to conſider that Chriſts Diſciples were but poor Ignorant and Unlearned <hi>Fiſhermen.</hi> They had not bin bred in the <hi>Schools</hi> of the <hi>Prophets;</hi> nor does it appear that their <hi>Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 25.</note> were very quick, or their <hi>Memories</hi> very ſtrong or retentive; <hi>Their old Bottles</hi> needed a great Reformation, before they were fit for the <hi>New Wine</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the <hi>Effuſions</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Chriſt was fain to open their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding after his Reſurrection, to help them to underſtand the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and<note place="margin">v. 45. Acts 1. 3. v. 8. Acts 2. 17. 18. John 16. 13. John 14. 26.</note> to teach them the concerns of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by Conference, and to ſend down the Holy Spirit, as well to <hi>enlighten</hi> them with further meaſure of <hi>Divine Knowledge,</hi> as to bring former inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into their <hi>Remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. As long as our Bleſſed Saviour does not charge them with <hi>Malice</hi> or <hi>Stubborneſs,</hi> we have no reaſon to do it. Nay, tho they were <hi>dull and ſlow</hi> of heart to believe, ſome Articles of great
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:66530:137"/> 
               <hi>difficulty,</hi> and not formerly propounded, or with very <hi>Little Evidence:</hi> Yet they <hi>Stubbornly</hi> rejected none, but were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from time to time, to comply with ſuch Notices as they clearly received from him; and were glad to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of any Errour. They did not finally deny his <hi>Godhead,</hi> or his <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> or the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel<note place="margin">John 20. 20. 28. Acts 11. 18.</note> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor yet <hi>diſpute</hi> any <hi>needful</hi> or <hi>uſeful</hi> Article.</p>
            <p>4. There is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Church in <hi>Fieri,</hi> and a Church in <hi>Facto:</hi> A Church that is a <hi>making</hi> and one that is <hi>eſtabliſhed:</hi> The Church that <hi>travel'd</hi> in the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> was not under ſuch fair Circumſtances, as that which was afterwards <hi>ſetled</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The caſe of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> can never be juſtified by any thing, that can be alledged under <hi>thoſe circumſtances;</hi> For we are now under a <hi>Setled</hi> Church, with <hi>Laws, Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> and all eſtabliſhed by mature and good Advice, and a juſt Authority. And the point in difference is drawn into ſo narrow a compaſs, that he who unfeignedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to know his <hi>Duty,</hi> (if he will take St. <hi>Paul</hi> for his <hi>Tutor, and Study to be
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:66530:137"/> quiet, and to do his own buſineſs,</hi>) He may learn it out of half a Text of <hi>Scripture,</hi> I mean <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 14. and we<note place="margin">Pag. 73.</note> have the <q>
                  <hi>Reconcilers</hi> own word for it, who tells us, That in this <hi>Very Chapter, the Apoſtles plainly ſaith, that the things Scrupled by the weak,</hi> were pure and lawful in themſelves, <hi>and that he knew,</hi> and was perſwaded by the Lord Jeſus that there was nothing unclean of it ſelf;</q> which ſaith the <hi>Reconciler,</hi> is as perfect and full determination of the <hi>caſe againſt the Weak,</hi> as words can make. Granting this to be true, I demand what is the Reaſon, if they be not <hi>Jews,</hi> that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed? I ſay, if they be not <hi>Jews?</hi> And let not the <hi>Reconciler</hi> conclude me <hi>Uncharitable</hi> for this Suppoſition; For the Doctrine and Practice of this <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Party,</hi> has been ſo long corrupted with ſuch a <hi>Jewiſh Leaven,</hi> that they have layn under that Suſpition at leaſt, theſe hundred years; inſomuch as <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perius</hi>

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:66530:138"/> the <hi>Tenor</hi> of this <hi>Rule,</hi> how ſad would be our Doom! For have not moſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had ſufficient Admonitions of thoſe Duties they neglect, and of thoſe ſins they do commit? Might they not eaſily be convinced of theſe things, by ſerious Reflections on their Actions: yea, doth not Conſcience often do that Office in them? And if in all theſe Caſes they muſt offend of <hi>Malicious Wickedneſs,</hi> and ſo be ſuch concerning whom the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> prays, that <hi>God would not be merciful unto them;</hi> May we not ask the <hi>Apoſtles Queſtion, who then can be ſaved?</hi> In a word, doth <hi>Peter</hi> ſay even of the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they through <hi>ignorance</hi> renounced and Crucified their <hi>Sauiour?</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi> that he through <hi>Ignorance did perſecute the Church of Christ?</hi> Could they (I ſay) do this through Ignorance in ſuch a a Cloud of <hi>Miracles,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> wrought? And may not our <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in ſuch a Conflict, as there is betwixt the <hi>Learned</hi> of our <hi>Nations</hi> touching Ceremonies, be thought to to err, not out of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Malice,</hi> but out of <hi>Ignorance and Prejudice,</hi> not out of want of <hi>Will,</hi> but <hi>Judgment?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <pb n="285" facs="tcp:66530:138"/>
            <p>Before I return an Anſwer, I muſt enter a <hi>Caveat.</hi> The <hi>Reconciler</hi> argues here as he did formerly, <hi>ex falſis ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitis, Upon falſe ſuppoſitions:</hi> That Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> affirms, that all the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to a man without exception, are<note place="margin">v. pa. 108.</note> 
               <hi>Proud, Froward, Stubborn, Malicious,</hi> &amp;c. This Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> does utterly deny, and takes it for a foul <hi>Slander.</hi> And he cannot but obſerve what <hi>Montaltius</hi> ſaies in his <hi>Provincial Letters,</hi> Whoever makes uſe of Lying, acts by<note place="margin">let. 11.</note> the Spirit of <hi>Satan.</hi> There's no <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the intention</hi> can rectify Calumny; and were it to Convert the whole World, it were not lawful to traduce the innocent; becauſe we muſt not commit the leaſt Evil to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the greateſt Good, and that the <hi>Truth of God doth not stand in need of our lying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I muſt tell this <hi>Reconciler,</hi> that be the <hi>Doom</hi> of ſuch perſons never ſo <hi>ſad,</hi> they are ſure to be judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this <hi>Rule;</hi> for do not they ſin <hi>Wilfully</hi> and <hi>Maliciouſly,</hi> who ſin fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, by <hi>Omiſſion</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Knowledg, againſt Conſcience, againſt Admonitions?</p>

            <p>There is ſcarce a ſin commited with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ignorance, but 'tis one thing to ſin Ignorantly, and another to ſin out of Ignorance: In <hi>that</hi> Caſe Ignorance does attend the ſin, in <hi>this</hi> it is the Cauſe of it: For Knowledge to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary would have prevented it.</p>

            <p>By the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of his Life and Miracles, their <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> might have known him to be <hi>the Son of the living God:</hi> But Malice blinded their<note place="margin">Wiſd. 2. 21.</note> eyes.

            <p>
               <q>There is a twofold Ignorance, ſaith he. <hi>Firſt,</hi> One has Rebellion joyn'd with it; from hence follows Obduration, and it is incurable; And this is Contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaith he, partly by acting obſtinatly and contemptuouſly againſt the Will of God, and partly by ſuffering the Threatnings and Judgments of God inflicted on us, to paſs by without A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment. This was in <hi>Pharoah</hi> and the People of <hi>Iſrael, Jer.</hi> 44. and 'tis ſeen in many of our time, who do ſo harden their hearts, that they reject the Grace that is offered to them in the Preaching of the Goſpel: St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks not of ſuch an Ignorance. But there is Another which pretends to the Glory of God, and ſuch is that he ſpeaks of. This is Curable, and yet 'tis a Sin in it ſelf, and deſerves no Pardon; nevertheleſs by Grace it may find Remiſſion, if it will ſuffer it ſelf to be corrected; but if it degenerates into that incurable Ignorance, then it

               <q>S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Caſe is much like that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jew's: Eſtius</hi> ſaies,</q> he could never obſerve, that ever <hi>Unbelief</hi> was pleaded to <hi>extenuate</hi> a Guilt: He obtained Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy becauſe his ſin was <hi>Great,</hi> and his condition <hi>Deſperate,</hi> and ſo he was fit for a <hi>Superabundant</hi> Grace to ſtrike in to reſcue him, and make him a <hi>Pattern</hi> for time to come.

But to ſatisfy you, ſaies <hi>He</hi> to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi> that we do not permit all things, know for Inſtance, that we never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a man ſhould have no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in Sinning, than a formal Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Sin; and that if any one be ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate, as in an Evil Action to Limit his deſire by the Evil it ſelf, we have no more to do with him; This is <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical,</hi> and admits of no exception, of Age, Sex, or Quality. But if a man be not ſunk into that wretched Condition, we endeavour to put in practice our Method of <hi>Directing the Intention,</hi> which conſiſts in a man's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to himſelf as the End of his Actions, an allowable Object.

               <q>Thus, you ſee, have our Fathers found out a Meanes to permit the Violencies men ordinarily Commit in maintaining their <hi>Honour.</hi> For there's no more to be done, than to <hi>divert the Intention</hi> from the Deſire of <hi>Revenge,</hi> which is ſinful, to incline it to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of maintaining ones <hi>Honour,</hi> which, according to our Fathers, is allowable.

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:66530:161"/> Rule of <hi>Equity,</hi> which doth enjoyn us to do to others as we would be dealt with; For we would not have others Judge raſhly of the Thoughts, and ſecret Purpoſes of our Minds, which they know not, nor of the inward Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our Actions, which they cannot diſcern; and would deſire them to Judge, as favourably as they can, of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages which they know.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this, the Anſwer will be very ſhort: I know 'tis the Ambition of all <hi>Hypocrites</hi> to be eſteemed better than they are, and 'tis their Study and Care as well as <hi>Artifice</hi> to ſeem ſo; but ſuch a man is a great <hi>Fool</hi> for his Pains, he may be deceiv'd himſelf, but God is not mocked by ſuch deluſions.

            <p>The <hi>Reconciler</hi> carries on his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus; <hi>When it is not evidently</hi>

            <p>Theſe <hi>Marks</hi> or <hi>Rules</hi> are Collected to my Hand by <hi>Montaltius,</hi> in his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter. 11.</note> The firſt whereof is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt. That the Spirit of Piety, inclines a man to ſpeak alwayes with Truth and Sincerity, whereas Envy and Exaſperation, ſpares neither Lies, nor Calumnies.</hi> 
               <q>If we advance things which are untrue, I ſay with St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> let our diſcourſes
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:66530:163"/> he reputed Infamous; but if we plainly ſhew, that what we do produce is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and manifeſt, it is no Breach of Moderation, and Apoſtolical Liberty to reprove them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> As the <hi>Firſt</hi> Rule is to ſpeak with <hi>Truth,</hi> ſo the <hi>Second</hi> is to ſpeak with <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion;</hi> 
               <q>Wicked Men, ſayes St. <hi>Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> perſecuting the Good, are hurried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the blind Paſſion that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates them. Whereas the Good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Wicked with a Prudent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, as <hi>Chirurgeons</hi> conſider where they Cut, but Murderers care not where they Strike.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> The <hi>Third</hi> Rule is, <q>That when a Man is obliged to fall into ſomething of <hi>Satyr,</hi> the Spirit of <hi>Piety</hi> inclines him to direct his wit againſt <hi>Errours,</hi> not againſt <hi>Holy things;</hi> whereas the Spirit of <hi>Sycophancy, Impiety,</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy,</hi> makes <hi>Sport</hi> with what is moſt <hi>Sacred.</hi>
               </q> I wiſh the <hi>Reconciler</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how Prophane he has bin, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>May-game</hi> of the <hi>Obſervances</hi> of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> I ſhall add but one Rule more, which is the <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of all the Reſt; and that is This.</p>
            <pb n="335" facs="tcp:66530:163"/>
            <p>
               <q>That the ſpirit of Charity inclines a man to make <hi>Hearty Wiſhes</hi> for their Salvation againſt whom He ſpeaks, and when He directs his <hi>Reproaches</hi> to <hi>men,</hi> at the ſame time to addreſs his <hi>Prayers</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> A man ſhould always with St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> preſerve Charity in his Heart, even when he is obliged to do outwardly things that to men ſeem very Harſh, and to ſmite them with a rough but obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Severity, their Advantage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prefer'd before their Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Practiſe of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who doubtleſs deſir'd the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch as apply'd themſelves to his Miniſtry, yet how did He upbraid the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Saducees</hi> with their <hi>Viperous</hi> Temper? How did He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value their <hi>Carnal Priviledge</hi> of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father, as if the conceit of that, had bin <hi>Charm</hi> enough to ſecure them from approaching Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance? How does He preſs them to a <hi>Worthy Repentance,</hi> threatning and even frightning them into it with the <hi>keen Ax,</hi> and a <hi>conſuming Fire;</hi> all this<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 7, 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> we are told in the ſacred Text; and 'twas no leſs an inſtance of his Love,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:66530:164"/> than the diſcharge of his Holy Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>We are now drawing towards the end this Chapter, and that were ſome comfort if were ſure he would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain us, (as he hath done too often al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready) with <hi>Repetitions.</hi> but he gives us fair hopes of an End, for he ſaies, <q>
                  <hi>Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> were the <hi>Scandal</hi> which <hi>Diſſenters</hi> take at the impoſing of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies <hi>Scandalum Phariſaicum,</hi> or like to that, which by the <hi>Phariſes</hi> was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en againſt the Doctrine of our <hi>Lord,</hi> I know not why we ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, to do all which lawfully we may, for the Prevention or Removal of it; For when our <hi>Saviour paid Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,</hi> leſt he ſhould offend them, did he not then forgo his Liberty to avoid the Scandal of the <hi>Phariſees?</hi> And when the <hi>Falſe-Apostles</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> were like to be <hi>offended</hi> at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> taking Wages, doth he not abſtain to prevent that Offence?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Reconciler</hi> is the only man I have met withall, that Loves to talk at <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and without diſtinction; he knows not why we ſhould not be concerned to prevent or remove the Scandal of a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> how far concerned, whether
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:66530:164"/> in <hi>Juſtice,</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> or upon what <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> account he doth not tell us. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I am ready to do, what <hi>Lawfully</hi> may, to ſuch a purpoſe, with all my Heart.</p>
            <p>When I find a man who has turn'd his Back upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to go to <hi>Jericho,</hi> if he has fallen into ill handling, and be wounded with Errour and Superſtition, I will not flatter him, that he is in a ſafe condition, like a <hi>Levitical Reconciler,</hi> but I'le endeavour to dreſs and bind up his Wounds, and deliver him to the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the Church for a perfect Cure; that is, in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I will tell our <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi> that we are not under the <hi>Law,</hi> but under <hi>Grace;</hi> that the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Inſtitution are out of Date, and that under the diſpenſation of the Goſpel there is nothing <hi>Common or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean,</hi> and Conſequently nothing <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous</hi> but <hi>ſin,</hi> or that which has ſome notable <hi>Appearance</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>That to ſuch as have put themſelves under Chriſts <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> there is nothing can affect or <hi>Defile</hi> the Conſcience, but what is Acted or Omitted <hi>contrary</hi> to his <hi>Holy</hi> Laws, and Inſtitutions; that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt of his Inſtitutions, he has Ordained Miniſters to <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> us in his ſtead, whoſe <hi>Faith</hi> and
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:66530:165"/> 
               <hi>Practice</hi> we are therefore obliged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, knowing that the End of their Converſation is the Salvation of our Souls. Having thus inſtructed them with all Meekneſs, and warn'd them to receive theſe things without Partiality, I have diſcharged my Duty, and delivered my own Soul.</p>
            <p>After this Chriſtian Condeſcention, if a pretended <hi>Weak Brother</hi> will be pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh and Diſobedient, if He will be <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,</hi> and forſake his Lawful-Paſtour, if he will take offence (which I have faithfully endeavor'd to prevent) and go to Hell of his own Head, becauſe I wear a <hi>Surplice,</hi> as the <hi>Badge</hi> of my <hi>Office,</hi> in my Adminiſtration about Holy Things; I have done no more than what becomes my <hi>Function,</hi> if he will Periſh, his Blood muſt be upon his own head.</p>
            <p>Again, if he will be Peeviſh and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, if he will be ſingular and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his Lawful Paſtour, if he will take offence and go to Hell, becauſe I ſign my Child with the Sign of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> as the <hi>Badge</hi> of my own <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and as an <hi>Item</hi> to him of his Duty and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, to his Crucified Redeemer; I have done nothing, but what does very well become my Chriſtian Profeſſion;
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:66530:165"/> If he will periſh in his Folly, his Blood muſt be upon his own head.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak but this once more; if he will be Peeviſh and Diſobedient, if he will be ſingular, and forſake his Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Guide or Paſtour, if he will take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and go to Hell, becauſe I fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my <hi>knees</hi> to ſay my Prayers, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail my ſins, to Receive a <hi>Benediction,</hi> and to adore my ever Bleſſed God and Saviour; I have done no more than what becomes me for ſuch invalueable Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; if he will dye in his wretched <hi>Schiſm,</hi> I am innocent, his Blood will be upon his own head. This Fraternal <hi>Admonition</hi> and Advice, is what I <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> may do; but if Men will <hi>make</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to themſelves in their own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and then <hi>take offence</hi> at them, who can help it.</p>
            <p>But this will not ſatisfie our <hi>Reconciler.</hi> I know very well what he would be at; The Governours muſt <hi>repeal</hi> their Laws, and <hi>abate</hi> their Impoſitions, or all is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ameſius</hi> ſaies, All things are to be done or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>without ſin.</hi> This, he ſaies, is the <hi>Obligation of Charity</hi> to avoid <hi>Scandal;</hi> But he means <hi>Scandalum Puſillorum,</hi> the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:66530:166"/> 
               <hi>Scandal of the Weak, or Little Ones;</hi> Not ſuch Scandal as is taken by men of a <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical</hi> temper.</p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle was reported to affirm, that we might do <hi>Evil</hi> to a <hi>good End;</hi> He took it for a foul <hi>ſlander,</hi> and ſaies, <hi>Their Damnation is Juſt</hi> who practice ſuch a Principle. Works under <hi>Precept</hi> are not to be omitted to avoid ſcandal, becauſe every man as he is bound to love himſelf before another, ſo is he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to avoid Sin in himſelf, rather than in Another.</p>
            <p>Are not Governours under the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of that Rule, <hi>Let all things be done Decently, and in Order.</hi> 'Tis a part of the Governours Office doubtleſs, to Eſtabliſh <hi>Good Order; For this Cauſe left</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>I thee in</hi> Crete, ſaies St. <hi>Paul, That thou ſhouldeſt ſet in order the Things that are wanting.</hi> This was the Burthen and Charge the Apoſtle laid upon <hi>Titus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t Eccleſiis nondum rite compoſitis formam daret; ut certam Politiciae rationem una cum Diſciplina conſtitueret;</hi> 
               <q>That he might Form and Faſhion the Churches which were not yet well Compoſed, and conſtitute a certain State and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Policy,</hi> with Diſcipline therein. To that end <hi>Titus</hi> was ſetled there,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:66530:166"/> ſaies <hi>Calixtus,</hi> that he might ſupply whatſoever was wanting, that might conduce to the <hi>Conſervation, External Regiment,</hi> and <hi>Ornament</hi> of the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is one Command that lyes upon the Perſon of the Governour, and there's another that lies upon him too, not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly as a <hi>Governour,</hi> but as a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in General, <hi>Rom. 4. 15, Let every Man be fully perſwaded in his own Mind.</hi> Is it not the Governours Duty to <hi>ſet things in Order</hi> in God's Church, as the Apoſtle <hi>enjoynes,</hi> and to be <hi>fully perſwaded in his own Mind</hi> that he does well in it? Shall he break God's Commands? Shall he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his Truſt? Shall he act againſt his own Practicall Judgment and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? He that can allow a Governour to do this, may make a Ghoſtly Father for the Devil; But he that ſayes, the Governour ought not to <hi>neglect</hi> his Duty, or to <hi>betray</hi> his Truſt, or to go againſt his own <hi>Mind</hi> and Conſcience, he muſt lay his hand upon his Mouth, and never move, either for a <hi>Repeal,</hi> or for an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement</hi> of the Laws, in favour of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters.</hi>

               <hi>of God of none effect by their Tradition.</hi> And he inſtances in the <hi>Fift</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; now this the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have done; firſt by their <hi>distinction,</hi> that the King is <hi>Singulis Major,</hi> but <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis Minor.</hi> According to the laſt <hi>Branch</hi> of this Diſtinction, who is the <hi>Father?</hi> Not the Prince, for he is <hi>Minor</hi> to the

            </p>
            <p>But becauſe this is ſo groſly abſur'd, and ſo perfectly contradicted, by the writings of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Fathers, and Holy Scriptures, therefore, to gain a <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> to Reſiſt their Prince, <hi>John Goodwin</hi> has delivered it for a great<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Joh.

            <p>But <hi>now,</hi> that this Antichriſt, <hi>is to be deſtroyed and caſt out, and the Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of</hi> Chriſtians (as he pretended) <hi>being the Men that muſt have the Principal hand in Executing God's Judgments upon the Whore;</hi> For bringing <hi>this</hi> to paſs, <hi>Now,</hi> ſaies he, in <hi>Theſe</hi> our times, <hi>God hath given out this Revelation to us,</hi> He hath manifeſted <hi>the Doctrine of Reſiſtance,</hi> and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:66530:174"/> Chriſtians may act <hi>contrary to the will of their Superiours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Doctrine of <hi>John Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> who tho he was a ſingle Perſon, yet he was a <hi>Leading-Man</hi> amongſt the <hi>Party,</hi> who generally followed his ſteps, and acted according to his Pernicious <hi>Principles.</hi> Thus have they made <hi>that Commandment of God of Non-Effect thro their Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How like <hi>theſe</hi> men were unto the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> we may Collect from the Character which <hi>Joſephus,</hi> tho himſelf a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> gives of them: He ſaies, <hi>They were a Crafty and Subtile Generation of men, and ſo perverſe even to Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they would not fear many times openly to affront and oppoſe them.</hi> And ſo far had they inſinuated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the affections and eſtimations of the Populacy, that their good or ill word was enough to make or blaſt any one with the People, who would impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly believe them, let their Report be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo falſe or Malicious. Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> in the Life of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Sect. 1. N. 6. Pag. 47.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore conclude in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the <hi>Reconciler,</hi> That ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Impoſitions</hi> of our Superiours, is neither a thing <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:66530:174"/> nor <hi>unneceſſary,</hi> we ought to practice it, tho the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at it. And herein the Doctrine of our Saviour upon that occaſion will bear us out, which ſignifies, that <hi>their</hi> Scandal is not ſo much to be eſteem'd, that we ſhould therefore ceaſe <hi>to Preach a needful Truth;</hi> and that how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may be offended, yet 'tis good to conſult the welfare of the People, <hi>Seduced by ſuch blind Guides; as lead them into the Pit</hi> by their Traditions.</p>
            <p>The next Aſſault the <hi>Reconciler</hi> makes<note place="margin">at <hi>Pag. 155.</hi>
               </note> is upon a Pittiful <hi>Trifling</hi> Adverſary, one <hi>Meiſner,</hi> a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> whom he ſlights with as much ſcorn and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as if he had not been worthy to carry his Books after him.</p>
            <p>It was pleaſantly ſaid by Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> of a Friends Letter—<hi>He ſets up Tops, and I muſt Whip them for Him.</hi> But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I am concerned for <hi>Meiſner;</hi> I brought him upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> and therefore am obliged in Juſtice to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as a <hi>Second</hi> in his Quarrel. 'Twas declared in the <hi>Verdict</hi> Page 272. that no Church of any Creditable Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would <hi>change</hi> their Eſtabliſhed <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> to gratify any Emergent <hi>Faction.</hi> Inſtances were given both of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:66530:175"/> and <hi>Calviniſts;</hi> How <hi>Rotarius</hi> was treated at <hi>Geneva,</hi> for the Breach of a <hi>Novel-practice</hi> there, was ſpecified at <hi>Page</hi> 280. But that <hi>Foolery,</hi> to ſay no worſe, the <hi>Reconciler</hi> paſſes over in deep ſilence, which is a conviction of his <hi>Partiality.</hi> For <hi>Meiſners</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments if they be not good, yet they Evidence the <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> That the <hi>Lutherans</hi> would no more recede from their eſtabliſhed <hi>Rules,</hi> than the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts;</hi> which is all that Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged them for.</p>
            <p>But perhaps <hi>Meiſners</hi> Arguments are not ſo Weak as his <hi>Prejudice</hi> would make them.</p>
            <p>The firſt of which is drawn from the <hi>Nature of things Indifferent,</hi> which is ſuch, as that they may be freely <hi>uſed</hi> or <hi>diſuſed, practiſed</hi> or <hi>abrogated;</hi> But when the Uſe or Diſuſe, the Practice or Abrogation is <hi>obtruded</hi> as of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> the nature of ſuch <hi>Indifferent</hi> things is violated. If he inquires what <hi>Meiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> means by <hi>obtruding,</hi> he had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no doubt as well as we, to mean an <hi>Inſurrection</hi> of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to <hi>Reform by force of Arms:</hi> But the <hi>Reconciler</hi> has made <hi>a Meaning</hi> for him, that is, when men <hi>thro the weakneſs of their Judgment
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:66530:175"/> do believe a thing Indifferent to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi> and having made <hi>this</hi> to be <hi>Meiſners meaning,</hi> he <hi>harrangues</hi> upon't with little Judgment and great Bitterneſs; But that he may not run away, and think to carry the Cauſe, as he uſes to do, by his falſe Surmiſes, let him ſtop a little and tell me, how the <hi>Diſſenter</hi> believes a thing <hi>Indifferent</hi> to become <hi>finful;</hi> for 'tis no leſs then <hi>Oppoſitum in Appoſito?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Does he believe it either with <hi>a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or Humane Faith?</hi> If with a <hi>Divine</hi> Faith, let him ſhew us ſome <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> for the Ground of it; If with a <hi>Humane</hi> Faith, that's only his <hi>Opinion,</hi> and that is to be Corrected by <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> or ſome other courſe of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> that it proceeds not to an obſtinate <hi>Superstition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But were <hi>Meiſner's</hi> meaning ſuch as the <hi>Reconciler</hi> would have it, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Civility</hi> ſhould have taught him better manners, than to Charge him, <hi>that he gave St.</hi> Paul <hi>the Lye:</hi> He had the Honour of a <hi>Learned Profeſſor,</hi> when he was alive at <hi>Wittengburge,</hi> and for that Reaſon the <hi>Reconciler</hi> ſhould have a little <hi>Veneration</hi> for his <hi>Aſhes,</hi> now he's Dead; eſpecially becauſe being
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:66530:176"/> Dead he yet ſpeaketh, in his Learned Writings.</p>
            <p>Some body ſure has ought this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler</hi> a ſhame for his Factious Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and has paid him home, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying him to ſuch groſs deluſions and miſtakes.</p>
            <p>What! <hi>Meiſner</hi> give St. <hi>Paul</hi> the lye? 'Tis impoſſible. He that gives ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man the <hi>Lye,</hi> muſt <hi>contradict</hi> him, He that <hi>contradicts</hi> another man muſt ſpeak <hi>Ad Idem</hi> in reference to <hi>the ſame Thing, the ſame Time, the ſame Place, the ſame Perſons,</hi> as alſo to the <hi>ſame Reſpect and Purpoſe.</hi> If there be any <hi>Variation</hi> in theſe Circumſtances, the Oppoſition will not amount to a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction</hi> or a <hi>Lye.</hi> 'Tis poſſible both <hi>Partyes</hi> may ſpeak the perfect Truth. For example, If I ſay the King forbad all <hi>Concourſe</hi> of People and <hi>Horſe-Racing,</hi> meaning, at ſuch a <hi>Time,</hi> and in ſuch a <hi>Place:</hi> And another man ſay, the King did not forbid the <hi>Concourſe</hi> of People or <hi>Horſe-Raceing,</hi> meaning at another <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place.</hi> Again, if I ſay the King for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids, that men ſhould keep <hi>Grey-Hounds, to Ride with Swords and Pistols, &amp;c.</hi> meaning Perſons of an <hi>Inferiour</hi> Rank and Quality; and another ſay, the King
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:66530:176"/> does not ſorbid Men to keep <hi>Grey-Hounds,</hi> or to <hi>Ride with Swords and Piſtols,</hi> meaning Perſons of a <hi>Higher</hi> Rank and Quality; here's no <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> no giving of the <hi>Lye</hi> to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <p>And thus it is between St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Meiſner;</hi> for St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>private</hi> Perſons, whom he forbids to <hi>Uſurp</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to give <hi>Law,</hi> or to <hi>Judge</hi> and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, where they have no Authority: But <hi>Meiſner</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Governours</hi> who are inveſted with <hi>Authority,</hi> and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to keep out <hi>Schiſms,</hi> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>good Order</hi> within their <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of a Church which was <hi>Inorganical,</hi> that wanted a due Settlement of <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Governours;</hi> but <hi>Meiſner</hi> ſpeakes of a Church that was <hi>Organized</hi> in all its <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Members,</hi> having <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> and a ſetled <hi>Diſcipline</hi> with <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> and Officers to execute the ſame. And this, among ſuch as have a little skill to apply it, will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to juſtify at leaſt <hi>Meiſners</hi> firſt and ſecond Arguments, without giving the <hi>Lye</hi> to the Apoſtle.</p>

            <p>In his <hi>ſecond</hi> Anſwer, Pag. 156. and 157. the <hi>Reconciler</hi> would oblige our Governours to <hi>betray</hi> their own <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> out of <hi>Commiſeration,</hi> and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> too by a pitiful Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification; for he would have our <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> quitt the ſtedfaſt <hi>Perſwaſions of their own Minds,</hi> in Favour to the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters.</hi> not to <hi>Correct</hi> the <hi>Errour</hi> of their Judgments, but to <hi>Careſſe</hi> them in their <hi>Superstition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Meiſners</hi> third Objection (<hi>Pag.</hi> 158) the <hi>Reconciler</hi> grows very <hi>Froward,</hi> and ſomewhat <hi>Ruder</hi> again than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him towards ſuch an Adverſary; but as 'twas obſerved of the <hi>Cynick,</hi> that he checkt the Pride of his great <hi>Viſitant,</hi> but with <hi>another</hi> Pride no leſs Inſolent, ſo may we truly ſay, that this <hi>Reconciler</hi> checks thoſe things which He's pleaſed to call <hi>Fooleries</hi> in <hi>Meiſner.</hi>

            <p>He Loves to <hi>Rhetoricate,</hi> but is not very good at diſtinguiſhing, which makes him at a Loſs and <hi>Blunder</hi> in his Anſwers; he was told in the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> Pag. 125. that a man has a <hi>Lock</hi> and <hi>Key</hi> in his own Boſom, and there he may keep his <hi>Chriſtian-Liberty</hi> ſafe enough from being plundred; and

            </p>
            <p>In <hi>His</hi> Anſwer to another Argument, (as he calls it) I muſt obſerve many things; Firſt the <hi>Distinction</hi> between <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> Liberty, He found in the <hi>Verdict</hi> (pag. 125.) and I am apt to believe he took it upon Truſt from thence, becauſe I have not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him ſo skilful or ingenious, as to
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:66530:179"/> uſe <hi>Diſtinctions,</hi> when there was juſt Cauſe for it; and becauſe he takes it up here <hi>Impertinently,</hi> for no Reaſon in the World, but to <hi>Cavil</hi> at it, and that he does <hi>Twice</hi> for failing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas he ſaith, the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 160.</note> would put no <hi>restraint</hi> upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as to the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, but only crave a <hi>Freedom</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence</hi> to themſelves; herein I believe (as we ſay) he <hi>Reckons without his Hoſt.</hi> No man that has read their <hi>Books,</hi> or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their <hi>Practice,</hi> or ſeen their <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinances,</hi> can believe it; And <hi>I</hi> doubt whether upon <hi>Second</hi> Thoughts, the <hi>Reconciler</hi> will believe it himſelf. In their <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1644, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Lords and Commons did declare, <hi>That they judged it neceſſary, that the Book of Common-Prayer be aboliſhed, and the</hi> Directory <hi>for the</hi> publick <hi>Worſhip of God eſtabliſh't and obſerved, in all the Churches within this Kingdom;</hi> And, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> the 29. 1648. <hi>They Ordain'd, that all Pariſhes and Places whatſoever, within the Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>and Dominion of</hi> Wales (<hi>as well Priviledg'd Places and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt Juriſdictions as others) be brought under the Government of</hi> Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Claſſical, Provincial, and National

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> His Anſwer is in Effect, no <q>Anſwer at all; For he ſayes, Firſt <hi>the Argument it ſelf pleads ſtrongly</hi> upon the Principles acknowledged in it, <hi>againſt the Impoſitions of Superiours,</hi> and even <hi>against all Vowes made</hi> by us concerning any thing <hi>indifferent:</hi> For both theſe things do put a Neceſſary <hi>Abſtention</hi> &amp; <hi>Reſtraint</hi> upon us, as to the uſe of theſe things: If therefore, ſayes he, by ſo doing they betray our Liberties, <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> ought not to yield to them, nor ſhould good Chriſtians,</q> by a <hi>Vow</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain themſelves from the <hi>Free uſe</hi> of things <hi>Indifferent;</hi> Secondly, <hi>He ſayes</hi> the Argument is <hi>Evidently Contradictor</hi> both to the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> of St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to which I muſt obſerve, that he ſtill abuſes his Reader-by his <hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> how elſe could he bring in <hi>Perſonal Vows, &amp;c.</hi> into his Anſwer? Among <hi>Orthodox-Divines</hi> who hath ever
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:66530:180"/> Queſtioned, whether a man that is <hi>Compos Mentis,</hi> might not reſtrain his <hi>own</hi> Liberty, and that as well by a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Vow,</hi> as a <hi>Prudent Reſolution?</hi> Or, who ever denied the Power of <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The not uſeing of our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Liberty renders us not the worſe, and therefore we may Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully not uſe it, when by <hi>Superiours</hi> we are reſtrained from the uſe thereof. <hi>Prot.

I'me ſure God does highly <hi>approve</hi> of their <hi>strict</hi> Obedience to the <hi>Impoſition</hi> of things <hi>Indifferent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return and ſhew, that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilers.</hi> Anſwer is <hi>Trifling</hi> and <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,</hi> not contradicting <hi>Meiſners</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. This I prove by <hi>Argumentum ad Hominem</hi> in this manner.</p>
            <p>That Argument which <hi>Pleads ſtrongly against the Impoſitions of Superiours,</hi> that Argument the <hi>Reconciler</hi> does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict: But <hi>Meiſners</hi> Argument <hi>pleads ſtrongly</hi> againſt the <hi>Impoſitions of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Reconciler</hi> himſelf, pleads as ſtrongly as he can, againſt the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Superiours; therefore he does
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:66530:181"/> not contradict <hi>Meiſners</hi> Argument, which, he ſaies, pleads ſo ſtrongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; the <hi>Minor</hi> is the <hi>Recomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> own Acknowledgment, as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may obſerve in his Words, above mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> The <hi>Reconciler</hi> contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and <hi>yeilds</hi> the <hi>Cauſe</hi> to his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; this is Evident to the <hi>Indifferent</hi> Reader; for if <hi>Meiſners</hi> Argument is <hi>evidently contradictory</hi> both to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as he ſaies it is, <hi>Page</hi> 161. then the Argument which <hi>pleads ſtrongly againſt the Impoſitions of Superiours,</hi> is <hi>Contradictory</hi> both to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and conſequently, both the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are for <hi>the Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Superiours,</hi> which is the thing we contend for.</p>
            <p>Here he inculcates again the <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> of abſtaining from ſome <hi>Meats,</hi> and the obſerving ſome <hi>Dayes,</hi> for fear of offending the <hi>Weak Brethren;</hi> Indeed the Apoſtle's expreſſion runs very high of not eating Fleſh, (which is one of<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 21. 1 Cor. 8. 13.</note> his <hi>two</hi> Inſtances,) But does he ſay the ſame things of the <hi>Time</hi> of God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?

            <p>From theſe and ſundry other Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it may appear, that although St. <hi>Paul</hi> in matters of <hi>Indifferency,</hi> did ſometimes both <hi>Adviſe</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> out of <hi>Condeſcention,</hi> and <hi>ſpecial Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> yet he came to a <hi>Standing-Rule</hi> at laſt, and 'twas no leſs his <hi>Judgment</hi> than his <hi>Practice,</hi> that ſuch things were <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> to be <hi>ſetled</hi> by <hi>Authority.</hi>

            <p>His <hi>Fourth</hi> Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> (which in Truth is to <hi>Meiſner</hi>) is but an <hi>Interrogation;</hi> and he is full of ſuch kind of ſuggeſtions; <hi>Can any man Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine?</hi> Is another of the ſame <hi>Topicks?</hi> and theſe go for Arguments; and indeed he concludes as Poſitively from them, as if he were at <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Commands</hi> with his <hi>Superiours:</hi> His preſent <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is it not apparent from what hath been diſcourſed, that there has been as great an alteration, both as to Ceremonies, and other matters contained in the Liturgy of</hi> Edward the <hi>Sixt,</hi> without the leaſt Confuſion; why therefore may not the like altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be now made without Confuſion? This is a doughty Anſwer: But,</p>
            <p>It verifyes the <hi>Obſervation</hi> of that Wiſe and Learned <hi>States-man</hi> above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and confirms the <hi>Ground</hi> of our <hi>Governours</hi> Refuſal to make any more Alterations: For grant <hi>one</hi> thing, yet that ſhall never ſatisfie, but only give the <hi>Party</hi> Encouragement to ask more; and they will never give over, till they
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:66530:192"/> have turned the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> out of Doors, to bring in their <hi>New Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del'd Service</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> This our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler cannot chooſe but acknowledge,</hi> if he has any Modeſty or Love of Truth, or has taken notice of what has been a doing this <hi>Fourty Years</hi> laſt paſt in theſe <hi>Kingdoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think Dr. <hi>Womock</hi> is no further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, either by <hi>Name</hi> or by any other particular Reference to his <hi>Verdict,</hi> in this <hi>Proteſtant Reconciler:</hi> But becauſe I obſerve he makes very great uſe of the <hi>Reverend</hi> Dr. <hi>Jeremy Taylor,</hi> I think fit to give one Caution to the Reader: He was a very Learned man for whom I had a great <hi>eſteem,</hi> not only becauſe he had a particular <hi>kindneſs</hi> for me, but becauſe he was a <hi>rare</hi> Perſon; For he was a man of great Reaſon, and of as great a <hi>Phantaſie,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> being the <hi>Lighteſt</hi> part of him, 'twas no wonder, if ſometimes it got <hi>uppermost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas the Reverend Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> Obſervation of him; that whatever <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> he undertook, he would <hi>drive</hi> it as far as was poſible to make it <hi>goe</hi> (we have an Inſtance in his diſcourſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Original Sin</hi>) and when he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Strength</hi> of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:66530:192"/> to carry it on by ſtrains of <hi>Witt</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick.</hi> And indeed having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up a <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Propheſying,</hi> (which his <hi>Majeſty</hi> of Bleſſed <hi>Memory</hi> was not pleaſed with, tho his deſign therein was to baffle the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>) he could never totally lay it down, till he came to be better <hi>poys'd</hi> and more deliberate; and that was when he came to be made a <hi>Biſhop.</hi> And it had been much more ſeaſonable and uſeful for our <hi>Reconciler,</hi> to have commended thoſe ſober <hi>Advices</hi> which he gave to his Clergy, at his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, then to have taken ſo much pains in gleaning out of his <hi>Ductor Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitantium,</hi> ſuch matters as (by his order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them) ſerve to pervert the hearts of Subjects, and ſet them againſt the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Impoſitions</hi> of their <hi>Governours,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Senſe,</hi> and conſtant <hi>Practice</hi> of that <hi>Excellent Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Advices</hi> I ſhall offer are much more for the edification of the <hi>Reconciler</hi> and his <hi>Clients,</hi> than all the <hi>Harangues</hi> of <hi>Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> which he has propounded in his Book, <hi>viz.</hi>

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:66530:193"/> of Mutiny to Preach to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Duty of their Superiours and Supream; it can neither come from a good <hi>Principle,</hi> nor tend to a good <hi>End.</hi> Every <hi>Minister</hi> ought to preach to his Pariſh, and urge their Duty: St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> told the Souldiers what the Souldiers ſhould do, but troubled not their heads with what was the duty of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.</hi>

            <p>XIX. <q>Let no <hi>Miniſter</hi> be governed by the Opinion of his People, and deſtroy his Duty, by unreaſonable Compliance with their humours, leſt as the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Granata</hi> told the <hi>Governours</hi> of <hi>Leria</hi> and <hi>Patti,</hi> like ſilly <hi>Animals</hi> they take bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens upon their backs at the Pleaſure of the multitude, which they neither can retain with prudence, nor ſhake off with ſafety.</q>

Let them know from you what they ought to do; but if you learn from them what you ought to teach, you will give but a very ill account at the day of Judgment, of the Souls committed to you. He that receives from the People
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:66530:193"/> what he ſhall teach them, is like a <hi>Nurſe</hi> that asks of her <hi>Child</hi> what <hi>Phyſick</hi> ſhe ſhall give him.</q>

            </p>
            <p>XXXVIII. <q>Never appeal to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the People in matters of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,</hi> teach them Obedience, not Arrogancy; teach them to be humble, not Crafty For without the aid of falſe Guides you will find ſome of them of themſelves apt enough to be troubleſome: and a <hi>Queſtion</hi> put into their Heads, and a power of Judging into their hands, is a putting it to their choice, whether you ſhall be troubled by them this <hi>week</hi> or the next; for much longer you cannot eſcape.</q>
            </p>

This is out of his <hi>Epistle.</hi>
               </q> In the Body of his Sermon his Doctrine and Advice is this.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You have no other way of Peace, no better way to appeaſe and quiet the quarrels in Religion which have been too long among us, but by reducing all men to Obedience, and all Queſtions to the meaſures of the Laws. For they on both ſides pretend Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but one ſide only can pretend to the Laws: And they that do admit no Authority above their own to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Scripture, cannot deny, but Kings and Parliaments are the Makers and proper Expounders of our Laws; And if ever you mean to have <hi>Truth and Peace kiſs each other,</hi> let no man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt your Laws. For did not our Bleſſed Saviour ſay, That an Oath is the end of all Queſtions, and after the Depoſitions are taken, all Judges
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:66530:200"/> go to Sentence? What Oaths are to Private Queſtions, that Laws are to Publick. And if it be ſaid that Laws may be miſtaken, it is true; but may not an Oath alſo be a Perjury? And yet becauſe in Humane Affairs we have no greater Certainty, and greater than God gives we may not ſeek for, let the Laws be the laſt Determination, and in Wiſe and Religious Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, no Diſputation is to go beyond them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>2. But this is not only true in <q>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Prudence, and plain Neceſſity, but this is the way that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and that he hath Bleſſed, and that he hath intended to be the Means of ending all Queſtions. This we learn from St. <hi>Paul, I Exhort that firſt of</hi>

                  <hi>all Prayers and Supplications, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for all men: for Kings and for all that are in Authority.</hi> For <hi>All;</hi> for Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and for Councils, for Biſhops, and for Magiſtrates: It is for <hi>All,</hi> and for <hi>Kings</hi> above <hi>All.</hi> Well, to what purpoſe is all this? <hi>That we may lead a quiet and Peaceable Life in all Godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Honeſty.</hi> Mark, that Kings and all that are in Authority are by
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:66530:201"/> God appointed to be the Means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>Unity,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> in Godlineſs, <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>3. And indeed becauſe this is God's <q>way of ending our Controverſies, the matter of Authority is highly to be regarded. If you ſuffer the Authority of the King to be <hi>Leſſened,</hi> to be <hi>Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,</hi> to be <hi>Denyed</hi> in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, you have no way left to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the Tongues and Hands of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying People. But ſo it is, the Kings Authority is appointed and enabled by God to end our Queſtions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: <hi>Divinatio in Labiis Regis</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) In Judicio non errabit os Ejus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 10.</note> Divination and a Wiſe Sentence is in the Lips of the King, and his mouth ſhall not Err in Judgment.

            <p>Upon theſe and many other weighty Conſiderations, I am induced to believe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Principal Inſtrument in ſetling the Government of the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and do concurr with the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Ingenious Dr. <hi>Cave,</hi> who ſums<note place="margin">In the Life of St. <hi>Peter</hi> Sect. 11. at the End.</note> up the Diſpute of St. <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome</hi> thus.</p>
